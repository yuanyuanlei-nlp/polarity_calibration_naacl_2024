## Task Description

The paper works on opinion summarization task. Opinion summarization enables automatically generating a summary from a large volume of opinions, reviews, or subjective text. The challenge of opinion summarization lies in presenting diverse or even conflicting opinions. This paper experiments on two types of opinion summarization tasks: summarizing product reviews that contain both positive and negative opinions, and summarizing multiple political articles that hold liberal or conservative political stances.


<br/>

## Dataset Description

We evaluate our approach using two datasets, each focusing on different types of opinions:

* **AmaSum**: the Amazon product reviews summarization dataset (https://github.com/abrazinskas/SelSum/tree/master/data). We use the version that contains a maximum of 100 reviews per product for experiments.

* **NeuS:** the political opinions articles summarization dataset (https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/framing-bias-metric/tree/main/data). The articles with different political stances that discuss the same event are grouped together as a cluster.
