{"source": ["Lawmakers block Trump's requested changes on coronavirus bill. Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday blocked attempts to alter a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and government spending package, leaving its status in doubt after President Donald Trump demanded extensive changes to the legislation. Democrats sought to increase direct payments to Americans included in the bill from $600 to $2,000 per person as part of a coronavirus economic relief initiative, acting on one of Trump\u2019s requests. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who oppose the higher amount, blocked that effort.", "House GOP, Dems stymie requests to reconsider stimulus, spending package after Trump grievances. House Republicans and Democrats Thursday blocked each others' \"unanimous consent\" requests put forward after President Trump aired grievances Tuesday night to the massive coronavirus stimulus and government funding package lawmakers sent to his desk. Democrats' request aimed at sending $2,000 relief checks to Americans was put forward by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. He said the Democrats' request was \"consistent\" with Trump's request. Republicans' request on revisiting foreign aid, the other element of Trump's twofold objections to the stimulus and spending legislation, was put forward by Rep.", "House Republicans Block $2,000 Coronavirus Stimulus Checks, Defying Trump. House Republicans defied President Donald Trump\u2019s wishes on Christmas Eve, blocking the passage of a proposal to include $2,000 stimulus checks \u2014 something the president demanded in an angry video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night while threatening to upend months of negotiations over government funding and coronavirus relief."], "target": "Lawmakers Disagree on Stimulus Changes; Vote Slated for Monday. On Thursday, Congressional Democrats and Republicans blocked each other's requested changes to the recent $900 billion stimulus proposal. Democrats sought to increase the planned stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000 in agreement with a request from President Donald Trump, but GOP lawmakers blocked the request. Democrats then rejected Republican efforts to revisit foreign aid allocations in the bill, an attempt that appeased another request from Trump. The House will hold a recorded vote Monday to address the proposed stimulus check increase, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Without Trump's signature on the stimulus bill, millions of unemployed Americans will lose benefits Saturday when jobless benefit programs established earlier in the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic expire. Government funds will run out this weekend unless Congress passes another stopgap funding measure by Monday."}
