{"source": ["Meet the Highest-Polling Libertarian Gubernatorial Candidate in the Country. Donald Rainwater, the Libertarian Party's (L.P.) candidate for governor of Indiana, has racked up some unprecedented polling numbers for a Libertarian in a race in which both major parties are running candidates. The 57-year-old Navy veteran and information technology professional hit as high as 24 percent in a Change Research poll back in September. While that very high result was an outlier, Rainwater has in the past week polled at 14 percent (in a Ragnar Research Partners poll) and 15 percent (in a Cygnal poll).", "The 3 biggest governor races to watch in 2020. As much change as the 2020 election might bring on a national level, it\u2019s unlikely to shake up many states\u2019 leadership: Of the 11 states with governor races in 2020, nine have incumbents running for reelection, many of whom are expected to coast to victory. That makes Montana, where current Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is leaving the seat open to run for US Senate, one of the cycle\u2019s most contested gubernatorial races.", "11 States Are Choosing Their Governor On Tuesday. Here Are The Races To Watch.. On Tuesday, voters will cast the last ballots in the Nov. 3 races for president, the U.S. House of Representatives and, in 34 states, the U.S. Senate. But in 11 states, voters will also pick their next governor. It\u2019s more common to hold governors\u2019 races during midterm elections, so the few gubernatorial contests held in presidential election years sometimes get overlooked while the spotlight is trained on races for federal office."], "target": "What to Watch for: 2020 Gubernatorial Races. Voters in 11 states will choose their next governor Tuesday, potentially affecting state policies and congressional maps after the 2020 census. Of the 11 states, nine have incumbents running for reelection. Polls suggest Republican incumbents will hold their offices in Utah, North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana; polls also project Democratic incumbents in Washington state and Delaware to be reelected. Governor races in Montana, Missouri and North Carolina have been widely identified as races to watch. Currently, Republican governors hold a 26-24 edge in the nation. "}
