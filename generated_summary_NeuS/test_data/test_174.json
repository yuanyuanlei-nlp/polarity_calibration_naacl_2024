Ossoff, a 33-year-old media executive, won a runoff election against Perdue, the one-term senator and former Fortune 500 CEO, who at 71 is more than twice Ossoff's age.

Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are projected to defeat incumbent Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in Georgia's two U.S. Senate runoff elections. The victories would put the Democratic party in control of the Senate; there would be exactly 50 senators from each party, but Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would have the power to break ties once sworn in. Ossoff's defeat of Perdue and Warnock's defeat of Loeffler were each decided by less than 100,000 votes. Georgia hasn't had a Democrat senator since 2000.
