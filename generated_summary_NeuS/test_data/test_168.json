A new peer-reviewed study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that in-school transmission of COVID-19 is \"extremely rare.\" In a collaborative study between Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, researchers discovered that among 11 school districts with nearly 100,000 staff and students, there were no instances of children passing the coronavirus to adults during in-person instruction. Researchers found just 32 cases of either kid-to-kid or adult-to-adult coronavirus transmission over nine weeks.", "Is it safe to send your kids to school?. Ten months into the pandemic, the prospect of reopening K-12 schools is divisive. Yet unlike wearing a mask to stop the spread of the virus \u2014 a politicized act which is scientifically proven to work \u2014 there is far more nuance between the \"right\" and \"wrong\" option for in-person schooling. And it can be wildly variable depending on the region. Recently, Chicago has found itself facing this very question of reopening schools.", "What we know about the spread of Covid among children \u2014 and whether shutting schools reduces the risk. The science around the link between children and the spread of the coronavirus is still evolving, but a growing body of evidence suggests that kids attending school do play an important role in community transmission. The issue comes as the resurgent spread of Covid-19 has prompted most of Europe to adopt the strictest level of public health measures, with many countries in the region shutting schools as part of a broader plan to curb infection rates and alleviate the strain on already stressed health facilities."], "target": "Calls For Schools To Reopen Grow As Studies Find COVID-19 Transmission Rate Low Among Children, Teachers Get Vaccinated. Calls to reopen schools grow as teachers receive the COVID-19 vaccine and studies show a low virus transmission rate among young children. A study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found in-school transmission of COVID-19 to be \"extremely rare,\" while a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) report found that COVID-19 cases among children remained low even after schools reopened in-person learning. Other state leaders promise to provide vaccines for teachers if in-person learning is resumed; Ohio's governor offered to vaccinate teachers in February if their school districts agree to resume partial in-person schooling by the beginning of March. Arizona's teachers are already receiving vaccines this month and are expected to resume in-person teaching shortly, despite the state reaching its highest virus diagnosis rate in the past week. These calls come as the U.S. recorded an all-time high of 4,327 COVID-related deaths on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. "}
