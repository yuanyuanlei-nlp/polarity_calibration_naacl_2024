Saturday turned deadly as a group of Donald Trump supporters clashed in the streets with BLM supporters.", "Patriot Prayer leaders says Portland shooting victim supported group. The man killed after Portland protesters clashed with Trump supporters was a backer of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, it was reported Sunday.

The mayor of Portland, Oregon, and President Donald Trump engaged in a real-time argument Sunday as the president sent a flurry of critical tweets about Ted Wheeler as the mayor was holding a press conference about the fatal shooting of a right-wing supporter in his city the night before.
