The Supreme Court refused to review a case involving a Kentucky law requiring doctors to describe ultrasound results to patients seeking abortions Monday. The lawsuit involved the state of Kentucky and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) suing on behalf of the state's last abortion clinic. The ACLU argued the case on First Amendment grounds, saying the law violates doctors' free speech by compelling them to describe ultrasounds. The refusal to review leaves the law in place; it was previously\u00a0upheld by the Sixth Circuit\u00a0Court of Appeals earlier this year."}
