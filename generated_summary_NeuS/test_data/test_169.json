News reports on the Trump administration's decision to divert $3.8 billion from the Pentagon to border wall construction, regardless of political leanings, focused largely on apparent bipartisan congressional disapproval of the move. Many focused on criticism from Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.
