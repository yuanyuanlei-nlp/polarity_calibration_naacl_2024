{"source": ["Trump's terrible Yovanovitch tweet wasn't the 'witness intimidation' voters care about. Keen to undermine House Republicans's entire impeachment strategy, President Trump took to Twitter to attack Marie Yovanovitch for not single-handedly saving Somalia, a failed state in its third decade of civil war, and Ukraine, from which he expunged her. Crucially, he did this as Yovanovitch was publicly testifying to the House Intelligence Committee as a part of the impeachment proceedings against Trump.", "Intimidation among key takeaways from the Trump impeachment hearing with Marie Yovanovitch. WASHINGTON \u2013 Marie Yovanovitch told lawmakers she had only U.S. interests in mind while serving as ambassador to Ukraine at an impeachment inquiry hearing Friday during which President Donald Trump tweeted insults at her. Yovanovitch, 61, also tried to dismiss debunked GOP claims that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections, and agreed that the military aid the Trump administration endorsed \u2013 and is now at the heart of the investigation \u2013 has benefited the Eastern European country in its war against Russia.", "A day that underscored the corruption swamping the Trump presidency. A fateful convergence of events Friday reflected a culture of corruption and intimidation endemic to the circle of a President who vowed to drain the swamp but instead became its incarnation. First, a US ambassador told how her reputation was shredded and she was hounded out of her job by President Donald Trump's rogue associates after a faultless 30-year career advancing America's interests."], "target": "Analysis From Day Two of Public Impeachment Hearings. The U.S. House Intelligence Committee concluded its second day of public impeachment hearings on Friday, with former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testifying about her work in Ukraine and ultimate removal from the post. Yovanovitch reiterated much of what she had reported in her closed-door deposition with lawmakers the month before, but the hearing also provoked a harshly critical tweet from President Donald Trump, which some Democrats and media outlets on the left condemned as a form of witness intimidation.  Yovanovitch is the third U.S. official to publicly testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry. Former Ambassador William Taylor and George Kent, the State Department's top official on Ukraine policy, appeared in front of the committee on Tuesday. Mark Sandy, a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget, is scheduled for a private deposition today."}
