Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has won the New Hampshire primary, Fox News projects, catapulting the 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist to the front of the still-crowded Democratic presidential primary field. Sanders had been leading top rival Pete Buttigieg and several other candidates as results came in throughout the evening, though only by a fraction of his 22-point margin of victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 New Hampshire primary. Buttigieg, meanwhile, touted his strong second-place finish as a sign that his campaign was \"here to stay.\"", "Bernie Sanders wins New Hampshire Democratic primary; Buttigieg, Klobuchar are top moderate candidates.

All agree the results were bad news for Elizabeth Warren. It was also a poor showing for Joe Biden who was in South Carolina pointing out, as many pundits did, that the race is still very young and these two states don't add up to much."}
