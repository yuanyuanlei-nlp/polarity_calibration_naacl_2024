A key panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus booster shots for people 65 years old and older, as well as those at high risk of severe COVID-19. Driving the news:\u00a0But in an unusual move, CDC director Rochelle Walensky late Thursday overruled part of the advisory committee's decision and said that workers in high-risk jobs should also be eligible for booster shots."], "target": "COVID-19 Booster Shots to Begin Soon for Certain Adults After CDC Recommendation. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster shot Thursday\u00a0for people ages 65 and older, as well as adults at high risk of severe COVID-19. Walensky's nod followed a similar recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panel; the panel's 15 advisers\u00a0unanimously supported the shots for ages 65+, and voted 13-2 to endorse giving Pfizer's booster\u00a0to people ages 50 to 64 with underlying medical conditions. Advisers voted 9-6 against endorsing the booster for ages 18-49, with the majority citing\u00a0concerns about the lack of evidence supporting the recommendation. But\u00a0Walensky disagreed, and officially recommended the shot for high-risk workers in that age group. Tens of million Americans may be eligible for the shots; roughly 55% of Americans are fully vaccinated."}
