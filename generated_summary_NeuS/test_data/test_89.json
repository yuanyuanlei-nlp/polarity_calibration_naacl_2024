The House Oversight Committee will probe Ivanka Trump's email use amid reports that she conducted official government business on her private email account. Some have criticized President Trump in the wake of the news, as he defended his daughter's actions but has consistently criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Others argue that the situations are vastly different, as Trump used her account to communicate small-scale administrative details, while Clinton sent and received highly classified information."}
