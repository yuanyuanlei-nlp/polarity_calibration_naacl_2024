A COVID-19 vaccine may be six months away, according to researcher leading a team of scientists in England. \u201cI think there\u2019s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine,\u201d Sarah Gilbert, a professor of virology at Oxford told The Times of London. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a hunch and as every week goes by we have more data to look at.

But the creation of a working vaccine that can be safely distributed to a broad population requires a tremendous amount of rigor and caution, so the process is likely to take at least a year. WIRED staff writer Megan Molteni has covered the novel coronavirus outbreak since the virus was first identified in early January. This week on Gadget Lab, we talk with Megan about where our efforts to make a vaccine currently stand.", "A New Front for Nationalism: The Global Battle Against a Virus. As they battle a pandemic that has no regard for borders, the leaders of many of the world\u2019s largest economies are in the thrall of unabashedly nationalist principles, undermining collective efforts to tame the novel coronavirus.

India, which produces staggering amounts of drugs, is ruled by a Hindu nationalist who has ratcheted up confrontation with neighbors."], "target": "US, Other Countries Race to Develop Coronavirus Vaccine. As coronavirus deaths in the U.S. and around the world continue to mount, scientists in various countries are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Researchers in England have reported success with a vaccine being developed there, saying it could be made available to the public as early as September.
