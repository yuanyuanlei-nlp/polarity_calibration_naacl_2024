WASHINGTON \u2014 President Biden\u2019s trillion-dollar bipartisan infrastructure plan suffered a significant setback late Thursday night when House Democratic leaders, short of support amid a liberal revolt, put off a planned vote on a crucial plank of their domestic agenda. Democratic leaders and supporters of the bill insisted the postponement was only a temporary setback. The infrastructure vote was rescheduled for Friday, giving them more time to reach agreement on an expansive climate change and social safety net bill that would bring liberals along."], "target": "House Delays Vote on $1.2T Infrastructure Bill. A House of Representatives vote on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill was postponed Thursday night, as lawmakers continue to negotiate terms of\u00a0President Joe Biden's larger $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package. Progressive Democrats have withheld support for the infrastructure bill unless\u00a0Congress takes up the\u00a0reconciliation bill, which covers \"human infrastructure\" and aims to bolster the country's social safety net. Some Centrist Democrats have opposed that bill's pricetag, and refuse to support it unless the price is reduced.\u00a0The infrastructure vote was initially planned for Thursday but was delayed due to a lack of support from Democrats. Government funding for surface transportation programs ran out on Thursday, making an agreement on\u00a0infrastructure funds vital. The House is scheduled to leave Washington D.C. for a two-week break\u00a0at the end of this week."}
