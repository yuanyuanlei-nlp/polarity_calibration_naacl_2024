{"source": ["Coronavirus shows Donald Trump was right all this time about China. Donald Trump has been insisting for years that our country has been too economically dependent on China, so it is sad that it took a global public health crisis to prove he was right all this time.", "President Trump Is Unfit for This Crisis. Period.. The coronavirus is no longer just a slow-moving public health crisis that may soon turn into a rapid-moving one. It\u2019s a crisis of transparency. It\u2019s a crisis of government legitimacy. So it is in this spirit that we all have to say: enough. Whose side is the Trump administration on? Based on every public appearance we\u2019ve seen so far \u2014 whether it\u2019s from a cabinet member or the director of the Centers for Disease Control or the president himself \u2014 the answer is clear: not the public\u2019s.", "Never mind Trump. Coronavirus shows why electing competent state and local officials is vital.. How the president responds to a disease outbreak is important, but it is only one aspect of multifaceted efforts at every level of government. Does a county have a system for prioritizing who receives virus tests and for delivering the results quickly? Will public transit be sanitized? Answering questions such as these is the real work of disease management \u2014 and it is not done by the White House."], "target": "Opinions: Trump and the Politics of Coronavirus. Opinions range far and wide on the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many voices, particularly on the left, criticized the U.S. and White House responses. Others, especially on the right, tended to focus more on China's response to the virus as being worthy of stricter scrutiny. Some minimized the role that the administration was playing, focusing instead on other key actors and decisions.  One author, writing in the Wall Street Journal, described how outbreaks like this are almost always political in nature. Another author (rated Center), writing in MarketWatch, described how President Trump could lose his political base by pushing liberal policies in response to the crisis."}
