The Trump administration on Tuesday blocked a planned deposition from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a central figure in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, according to a statement by his lawyer. Democrats swiftly called the administration\u2019s move an act of obstruction and accused President Trump of hiding information about his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals. Democrats had earlier said that any attempt to block statements from witnesses could constitute an impeachable act.", "State orders EU ambassador not to testify before House. A key witness in the House impeachment inquiry was ordered not to appear at a scheduled deposition on Tuesday, ramping up tensions between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration. The State Department instructed Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland not to appear for the deposition, according to his counsel.", "State Dept Blocks Ambassador Sondland From Testifying Before Congress About Ukraine. President Trump explains why Sondland shouldn't testify. @realDonaldTrump I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions."], "target": "State Department Blocks Ambassador Gordon Sondland From Testifying In House Impeachment Deposition. The State Department has blocked Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, from testifying at a scheduled deposition on the Ukraine controversy. Sondland is a key figure as he had texted with Bill Taylor, a top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, arguing over allegations of a quid pro quo. This move by the State Department has triggered a new clash with House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry, and President Trump has dismissed the deposition as a \"a kangaroo court\" as he defended the State Department decision."}
