Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to raise or suspend the debt ceiling as soon as possible on Wednesday, warning that inaction could lead to a historic default in October. \u201cA delay that calls into question the federal government\u2019s ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets,\u201d Yellen said.
