A new study from the American Academy of Pediatrics has found that COVID-19 transmission in schools is extremely rare. The study, conducted by Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, examined 11 school districts with nearly 100,000 staff and students and found no instances of children transmitting the virus to adults during in-person instruction. Over a nine-week period, researchers only found 32 cases of either child-to-child or adult-to-adult transmission. The safety of sending kids to school during the pandemic is a divisive issue, with varying circumstances depending on the region. Evidence suggests that children attending school may contribute to community transmission. Many countries in Europe have resorted to shutting schools as part of efforts to control infection rates and reduce strain on healthcare systems.
