The US House of Representatives has delayed a vote on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill due to opposition from progressive Democrats. These Democrats refuse to support the bill until Congress takes action on a larger $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, which includes measures such as climate change initiatives, healthcare expansion, public education, paid leave, childcare programs, and tax increases.

He asked for patience, explaining that the Biden administration is striving to manage the situation. In the meantime, Republican lawmakers are demanding a hearing on what they perceive as a border 'crisis', led by Rep. James Comer, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

The legislation proposes to outlaw both federal and state law enforcement, who receive Justice Department funding, from carrying out such warrants. The bill's introduction has bipartisan backing amid ongoing debates on wider police reforms.

Bernie Sanders has won the New Hampshire primary, closely followed by Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar in third place. However, Sanders' narrow victory leaves the Democratic field unsettled with no clear frontrunner. His victory is less than dramatic compared to his 2016 win over Hillary Clinton by over 20 percentage points in the same state. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has interpreted his second-place finish as a sign of his campaign's longevity, and Klobuchar's unexpected third-place finish has emerged as another significant development from the primary.

This meeting will also provide insights on the direction of the party as it navigates a post-Trump era but continues to deal with his influence on GOP voters.
Donald Trump has expressed concern that the migrant caravan is not sufficiently motivating his political base ahead of the midterms. This follows his longstanding use of fears about non-white immigrants to drum up support. The Defense Secretary has approved the deployment of more U.S. troops to the Mexican border in order to deter this caravan of migrants and asylum seekers, a move in line with Trump's vow to use the military to stop such caravans. Approximately 800 soldiers have been ordered to the southern border in response to the caravan originating from Honduras.

The DREAM Act, which has failed to pass on multiple occasions over the past 16 years despite both Democratic and Republican support, could face renewed opposition following President Trump's cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ('DACA') programme, which protects 'Dreamers' from deportation. Senator Cory Gardner has said that he will support the act.
Britain’s National Health Service has initiated its mass vaccination campaign with the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the world's first fully tested and clinically authorized vaccine.

The UK has 800,000 doses available for the start of the program, facing the challenge of distributing a compound that needs to be stored at -70C (-94F). This vaccination campaign is seen as a test case for the rest of the world.
President Donald Trump will not respond to federal investigators' questions on whether he tried to obstruct the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, says his attorney Rudy Giuliani.

This will be his first appearance on Capitol Hill since falling out with the Trump administration over quotes attributed to him in a controversial book.
Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer has announced that the Senate will vote to open debate on the bipartisan infrastructure deal on Wednesday. This will be a key test vote for the yet-to-be-finalized legislation. Schumer plans to file cloture on a shell bill, into which the bipartisan legislation will later be inserted. Schumer also revealed that the Senate will vote on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure measure and a budget resolution seeking an additional $3.5 trillion for social spending programs. The move comes after President Joe Biden urged Senate Democrats to support both bills.
The Trump administration has issued a rule restricting federal funding for abortion clinics. Groups providing abortions or abortion referrals will no longer be able to participate in the $286 million federal family planning program. This includes taxpayer-funded clinics serving primarily low-income Americans. The rule also makes it challenging for abortion providers to offer birth control. The move aligns with the administration's plan to defund Planned Parenthood.

The Vatican has released a document rejecting the concept of individuals choosing or changing their gender. The document, titled "Male and Female He Created Them", argues that acceptance of fluid gender definitions could undermine traditional families and disregard natural male-female differences. It suggests that gender is determined by biology, not personal feelings, and that this notion is an attempt to "annihilate nature". The Vatican's statement has been criticised by LGBT rights advocates who argue it could promote hatred and bigotry.

President Donald Trump used Twitter to attack former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, as she was publicly testifying in the impeachment proceedings against him. He criticised Yovanovitch for her service in Somalia and Ukraine. During the impeachment inquiry hearing, Yovanovitch defended her record, dismissing GOP claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 US elections, and argued that the military aid Trump endorsed, and is now under scrutiny, has been beneficial to Ukraine in its war against Russia. Events highlighted a culture of corruption and intimidation within Trump's circle, as described by an ambassador whose reputation was damaged by Trump's associates after a successful 30-year career.

A gunman, suspected of killing five police officers during a protest march in Dallas, told negotiators before he died that he was upset over recent police-involved shootings of African Americans and "wanted to kill white people, especially white officers," according to Dallas Police Chief David Brown. The community had gathered to protest the police-related shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota. However, the initially peaceful protest devolved into a horrific attack on law enforcement that left 12 police officers shot.

The US Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding the Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This Obama-era program protected about 700,000 young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation.

This is reportedly the final extension of the pause introduced by the Trump administration in March 2020.
President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the Taj Mahal during their official trip to India.

His attempts to challenge the election results in courts have been unsuccessful so far.
The New York Times editorial board has endorsed two presidential candidates for the first time in its history, opting to support Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. This decision, made two weeks ahead of the first primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, is a departure from the board's traditional practice of endorsing a single candidate. The Times had traditionally supported establishment favorites, demonstrated by its previous endorsements for Hillary Clinton. The decision and the process of selecting the endorsed candidates were documented in the newspaper's show "The Weekly" on FX.

Following this, China has threatened retaliation.
President Joe Biden is due to keep the annual refugee admissions at 15,000, a historically low figure set by former President Trump. Despite earlier pledges to raise this cap, Biden will instead amend the regional allocation of the admissions, increasing slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East, and Central America, and lifting previous restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. This means that while the overall number of refugees accepted remains the same, the distribution of where they come from will change.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to issue stricter guidelines for the emergency authorization of any new coronavirus vaccine to ensure its safety and effectiveness.

The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, but later allowed to stay for humanitarian reasons, are not eligible to apply for permanent residency or green cards. The decision could impact thousands of immigrants, including those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a designation given to countries affected by war or natural disaster. This decision comes from the case Sanchez v. Mayorkas, which was taken up by Jose Sanchez and Sonia Gonzalez, natives of El Salvador who had entered the U.S. unlawfully.
Former Massachusetts Governor, Bill Weld has become the first Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race.

The unconventional presidency of Donald Trump has prompted journalists to ask questions they never thought they would, due to his unpredictable demeanor. This unpredictable nature has significantly changed the media landscape, and is expected to heavily impact the President's second year in office. Despite journalists referring to the Trump era as a "golden age" of journalism, media coverage during 2017 has been marked by numerous errors and sensationalist stories that didn't deliver as promised.
The US budget deficit rose by 26 percent to nearly $1 trillion in 2019, jumping by $205 billion in comparison to the previous year, the highest level since 2012. The soaring deficit is expected to cross $1 trillion in the current budget year and stay above that threshold for the next ten years. This increase is contrary to President Trump’s campaign promise to eliminate federal debt within eight years. Factors contributing to the deficit include the 2017 Trump tax cut which led to revenue loss, a budget deal that increased spending for military and domestic programs, and a failure to control spending on entitlement programs.
President Trump has said that he has been taking the drug hydroxychloroquine as a preventative measure against COVID-19. Despite the drug's effectiveness against the virus being unproven, Trump claimed that many front-line workers are also taking it.

It remains unclear what caused the outage, and the sites returned to normal operation within about an hour.
There are multiple signs pointing towards a landslide victory for the Democratic party in the upcoming 2020 election. President Trump's ratings on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic are reportedly collapsing, with a Washington Post-ABC News poll showing that only 38% approve of his response. Furthermore, the voters who don't like either candidate, a group that helped Trump in 2016, appear to be leaning away from him this time, according to a Morning Consult poll. Grim news and economic woes are also affecting Trump's campaign negatively. Recent polls including The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll give the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, a significant lead.

In addition to the arrests, company business records were also seized during the raids.
Former National Security Adviser and UN Ambassador Susan Rice has been named as Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.

Although the number of new unemployment filings has stabilized since late March, millions of workers remain unemployed due to pandemic restrictions. Approximately 43 million American workers have applied for unemployment insurance since mid-March. The recent data also revealed that this is the tenth week that claims have fallen, and the eleventh straight week with claims exceeding 1 million. Before March, claims had never surpassed 700,000. The number of people claiming ongoing unemployment benefits fell to 20.9 million in the week ending May 30. Despite states processing a backlog of claims, new applications have decreased since the surge in late March.

The decision affects over 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the US as children.
President Trump has claimed that he has "total" authority to lift the coronavirus lockdown, regardless of the opinions of governors and legal experts. While Trump insists he has the ultimate authority, the US Constitution states that states maintain public order and safety. As of his statement, 10 states in the US were planning to lift their strict stay-at-home orders. However, Trump's claim contradicts the actions of 10 governors from the East and West coasts, who announced they were crafting joint plans to reopen schools and businesses in their states. His statement has drawn further concern, given the backdrop of the US being the current global epicentre of the pandemic.
The nuclear summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended abruptly in Hanoi, Vietnam without any agreement reached. The failure to make an agreement was due to Kim insisting on a lifting of sanctions without committing to eradicate his country's nuclear weapons.

Despite the unsuccessful summit, Trump remarked that some progress had been made in building relations and discussing denuclearization.
Since the start of the academic year, at least 1,000 schools in 35 U.S. states have been forced to close for in-person learning due to COVID-19, according to data from Burbio. This has led to shifts in remote learning, temporary closures without instruction, and delayed school starts. At the same time, cases of COVID-19 among children are on the rise, making the situation even more challenging. Meanwhile, Alabama schools reported 13,000 COVID-19 cases in a two-week period, based on data from the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Alabama State Department of Education. This number could potentially be higher as only 84 out of the 143 school districts reported their data.
Bay Area health experts have warned that impromptu celebrations following Joe Biden's projected victory in the 2020 presidential election may lead to an increase in the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Images of large crowds celebrating the Biden-Harris win is indicative of a disregard for social distancing recommendations.

President-elect Biden has yet to address these concerns.
The repeal of net neutrality rules officially takes effect on June 11, opening the possibility for internet service providers to charge customers more for certain content or to block or slow down access to specific websites.

During his inauguration, Biden called for American resilience and unity to face the nation’s multitude of crises. The former president, Donald Trump, who has yet to formally concede, did not attend the ceremony. Biden has announced his intentions to reverse some of Trump's key policies through a number of executive orders.

A COVID-19 vaccine may be six months away, according to Sarah Gilbert, a professor of virology at Oxford who is leading a team researching the virus. However, this contradicts reports from other scientists who maintain that a vaccine will likely take at least a year to develop due to the rigorous process and safety standards involved. Meanwhile, nationalism is hampering global efforts to combat the virus, with leaders from the US and India being notable examples of those prioritising domestic affairs and conflicts over international cooperation.
Former independent Michigan congressman, Justin Amash, is running for the US Presidency as a Libertarian. His decision could have a significant influence on the 2020 presidential race.

The committee will also have the power to subpoena witnesses. The House is expected to vote on the bill this week.
Donald Rainwater, the Libertarian Party's candidate for governor of Indiana, has achieved the highest polling numbers for a Libertarian in a race where both major parties are running candidates. This 57-year-old Navy veteran and IT professional reached up to 24% in a poll in September. In the 2020 election, with 11 states having governor races, only Montana's is considered highly contentious due to the incumbent, Steve Bullock, running for US Senate. Usually, the focus is on federal office races during presidential election years, so governor races are sometimes overlooked.

The move forms part of a new effort to increase vaccine supply and manufacturing capacity, mainly in the US.
The House of Representatives will vote on two immigration bills as the number of migrants detained at the U.S. southern border grows. The Dream and Promise Act would grant a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The Farm Modernization Workforce Act aims to establish a certified agricultural worker status and streamline H-2A visa applications. The bills, which are seen as a step forward in the process of comprehensive immigration reform, could indicate the prospects of wider-reaching changes in this Congress session.
Workers essential to global supply chains, including seafarers, truck drivers, and airline workers, are warning of a potential system collapse due to challenges from the pandemic. The workers have faced quarantines, travel restrictions, and complex vaccination and testing requirements, pushing many to their breaking point.

Iran announced it will increase its uranium enrichment levels, breaking another limit set by its 2015 nuclear deal, thus heightening tensions with countries like the US. This marks the second intentional violation in a week, risking a complete collapse of the nuclear agreement. The country warned it would bolster nuclear activities to pressure Europe, China, and Russia into providing relief from stringent US economic sanctions and to raise costs to Washington for continuing its maximum-pressure campaign. This move inches Iran closer to being able to produce a nuclear weapon.
The Senate voted 57-43 to acquit former President Donald Trump of the charge of "incitement of insurrection" after the House passed an impeachment article last month for his role in the rally at the U.S. Capitol on January 6.

The senators who voted to convict were Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. This marked the end of Trump's second impeachment trial.
The Biden administration plans to ask U.S. attorneys appointed by former President Trump to resign but will exempt U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who is overseeing a tax probe into President Biden's son, Hunter, according to a senior Justice Department official. This is standard procedure for a new president, but the fate of Weiss, who runs the office in Delaware, has been a topic of speculation. In a call on Monday, acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson asked Weiss to stay in his post. Another top prosecutor overseeing a sensitive Trump-era investigation in Connecticut is also expected to retain his position.
New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, and California Governor, Gavin Newsom, have both ordered statewide lockdowns in response to the worsening Coronavirus pandemic. This includes shutting down most non-essential businesses and instructing residents to stay at home.

President Trump has expanded his travel ban to include Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. These six new countries join the previous seven - Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen - under increased restrictions. The US has cited a lack of cooperation and adequate security measures from these countries as the reason for the ban. Residents of these countries are now prohibited from obtaining certain types of visas; however, they may still enter the US as tourists. Critics argue this expanded ban perpetuates discrimination against Muslims, while the government insists it is a matter of national security.
Polls closed in Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia in an off-year election viewed as a gauge of voter sentiment ahead of the 2020 general election. The results will also test President Donald Trump's ability to rally Republican voters amidst impeachment proceedings and the Democrats' opportunities to capitalise on his unpopularity. Trump notably involved himself in the closely contested governor's races in the South. In Kentucky, Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin was narrowly leading Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear.
Hong Kong's main airport terminal was the site of a confrontational clash between police and protesters. Several arrests were made, and at least one person was injured in the scuffle. Despite the demonstrations, which resulted in hundreds of flights being cancelled over a two-day period, most of the protesters had left the airport not too long after the initial conflict. The Hong Kong police claimed they were at the airport to rescue people captured by the protesters.

The protest, marked by chants, songs, banners, and pepper spray, was part of a broader political crisis in Hong Kong.
President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at stopping family separations at the border, a crisis which had been threatening his broader immigration reform aspirations.

Mondale served as vice president under Jimmy Carter from 1977-1981 and was the Democratic nominee for president in 1984, a race he lost to Ronald Reagan. He passed away peacefully of natural causes at his Minneapolis home, surrounded by his family. His death was confirmed by a family spokesperson and widely reported. Despite his 1984 electoral defeat, Mondale received widespread respect, with calls of appreciation in his final days from fellow politicians including former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and current President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. His liberal legacy remains intact.

A new study conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill found that in-school transmission of COVID-19 is extremely rare. The study examined nearly 100,000 staff and students over nine weeks in 11 school districts, finding no instances of children transmitting the virus to adults during in-person instruction. The question of reopening schools remains under debate, with decisions varying greatly by region. While there is growing evidence that suggests children play a role in community transmission, the science around the link between children and the spread of the virus continues to evolve. Many countries in Europe, faced with a resurgent spread of COVID-19, have shut schools as part of their public health measures.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in military funding to help pay for President Donald Trump's promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon has plans to divert $3.8 billion intended for military equipment towards the construction of the wall, which has drawn bipartisan outrage from Congress and revived a long-running funding battle. The Trump administration's plans have been widely criticized as a challenge to the legislative branch's power of the purse.
Court filings have shown that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was authorized by Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, to investigate former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort's lobbying activities in Ukraine and possible collusion with Russian officials.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has signed a significant overhaul of the state's election laws, amid protests from Democrats and voting rights groups. The Republican-sponsored overhaul introduces new restrictions on mail voting and gives legislative bodies greater control over elections. It is suggested that these laws will disproportionately affect voters of color. The overhaul is part of numerous GOP-backed election bills introduced in states across the US, following allegations of fraud in the 2020 election by former President Donald Trump. The changes to Georgia's election laws include new limitations on mail-in voting, increased access to in-person early voting, and more legislative power over elections.
Democrats have gained control of the Senate following Democrat Jon Ossoff's victory over Republican former Sen. David Perdue in Georgia. This, along with Democrat Raphael Warnock's win over GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler in another Georgia race, puts Democrats in control of the upper chamber of Congress. This not only provides the Democratic Party control over Congress for the first time in a decade, but also allows President-elect Joe Biden to pass through Cabinet nominations and potentially implement sweeping liberal legislation without Republican support. These election results represent a significant shift, as Republicans had made gains in the House and retained Senate control in the November elections.
A new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that unvaccinated people are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated, highlighting the significance of vaccines in managing the pandemic.

The U.S. House of Representatives, containing both Republicans and Democrats, has blocked alterations to the $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and government spending package. This comes as a response to President Donald Trump's call for widespread changes to the legislation. Democrats attempted to increase the direct payments to American citizens from $600 to $2,000, aligning with one of Trump's requests. However, this effort was hindered by Republicans. Both sides also hindered their peers' "unanimous consent" requests that were based on their interpretations of Trump's complaints about the stimulus and spending package. Despite Trump's insistence, House Republicans blocked the proposition to include $2,000 stimulus checks.

The Trump administration's legal justification for the drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani has been released, citing a president's authority to protect national interests and the 2002 authorization for use of military force. However, reports contradict the administration's claim that the strike was due to an imminent threat from Soleimani. A Monday report showed that the drone strike decision was cleared seven months before it was made, casting doubt on the claim of imminent danger. A congressionally-mandated memo from the White House to lawmakers stated that the strike was in response to an escalating series of attacks by Iran and Iran-backed militias, and contradicted previous statements about an 'imminent threat.'

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into waters off its east coast, marking its first ballistic missile test in six months, which is a breach of UN resolutions. South Korea and the US are currently analyzing more details about these launches. This action occurred amid discussions between South Korea and China on resuming denuclearization talks with North Korea, which is facing a severe economic crisis.

The efforts to discredit Dr. Fauci, which include sharing a list of his alleged misstatements and intensifying criticism, come as he continues to express concern about reopening the country amid surging Covid-19 cases. The development also follows Dr. Fauci's recent revelations about his strained relations with President Trump, including their lack of communication in recent weeks. This disclosure also seems to have prompted Trump to share anti-Fauci messages on social media.
Former South Carolina governor and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has been mocked for claiming that the Confederate flag symbolised "service, sacrifice, and heritage" until Dylann Roof "hijacked" it.

Consumer prices in the U.S. rose in June, marking an end to three consecutive months of declines. The increase was driven by a rise in the cost of gasoline and food. The consumer price index, which measures what Americans pay for a range of goods and services, increased by 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis. This is the biggest gain since August 2012.
