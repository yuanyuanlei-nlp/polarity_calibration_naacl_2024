Installed super easy, if I do say so myself.	It's almost too easy to use, so simple any child or elderly person could use it alone.	Makes a TV smart for 30 USD.	This unit gets a little wonky during playbacks.	I use the USB cable and have not had an issue with it losing power.	Like choices, have Apple TV as well and like this so much better.	Overall works for it's current purpose
Simple sleek remote with only the few buttons you actually need.	This was the only one I could find for my less than 2,000 budget.	We don’t need a sound bar for this....very surprised by the audio.	When watching 4K content the colors are so vibrant what’s not to like?	The picture quality is fantastic, it was easy to set up, the sound is perfect for a large living room - no additional sound bar
The ear buds hurt my ears if I wear them too much but are easier to wear when I am lying down or when I want to be less conspicuous.	I ordered the product that is designated for Apple products, but the plug does not fit my Apple iPod or Apple iPad.	If you travel on airplanes a lot then these are for you, the noise cancelling is top notch.	These headphones are great!	I
This is the CPU to have in 2018.	Easy to install.	The improvement over the 4c/4t 6600k I was running at 4.1ghz is substantial, and I can stream in OBS while still pulling full FPS in all my usual games (PUBG, CSGO, etc.).	Everyone wants the k series but overclocking is over rated.	Especially if you want to overclock it	Run this all day at 5.0 ghz and when needed absolute stability at 5.1 ghz
Really disappointed !!	It's a game changer camera.	Since I do a lot of theatre photography, that is really important for me.	The focus was incredibly unreliable as well ad the white balance.	Loved the two AWB settings one typical canon warmth other one with more white biased.	Yes, pricy, but loving this camera!	This camera has totally redefined the 5 D camera line.	However, touch screen, improved AF, intuitive menu and work flow efficiency
However, this monitor is well built and works great.	Thankfully I only use it at my home office 1-2 days a week for a second screen.	The quality is good.	The first day it could be made to work by adjusting the connection, now it won't stay on couple of seconds.	It did occasionally blink out but it was very nice to have.	I have many AOC monitors so I was very disappointed in how
The remote doesn’t work 95% of the time, the tv never can connect to amazon cloud services, and it freezes.	We reached out to Best Buy to resolve this.	It’s easy to navigate.	Integrated remote with Netflix and Prime is great- it’s making my Apple TV unnecessary.	Called amazon and they didn’t seem to care.	I have to switch inputs back and forth a couple times.	Went to an actual brick and mortar store this
The price on here is also almost $120 less than major retailers!	The blue tooth connection is extremely weak.	Apple CarPlay when iPhone is plugged into it.	Easy to install.	Did it right — installed the microphone at my speedometer.	First impressions are good.	Also, sometimes the album art displayed is the one for the previous song.	Amazon says I can't return or exchange after march 1st, how convenient, so out 230 bucks and have
Update the free app all day long.	Lets me take my cable service with the wherever I go.	Other than that, I love having the access - when the weather is good, there are no connectivity problems.	With Slingbox our tv is used less when only one person wants to watch a recorded on the dvr.	We're using it with an older TiVo Premier and everything works great, better than the one I replaced.	Now
After reading the reviews I went and purchased it.	I understand why it's referred to as the nifty fifty and I tend to shoot more with it now than any of my other lenses plus it's light and less cumbersome but the quality of the colors and crispness is amazing.	All I had before this were stock lenses that came with my mom’s canon rebel t4i.	Super sharp.	Beautiful lens.	Great build quality and bokeh,
Also, if you have sensitive inner ear problems, these will cause a horrible sea-sick feeling of nausea and headache.	The headphones are indeed gorgeous, however these don't live up to the technical expectations I had for them.	I had to send these back because the sound quality was uncomfortable.	He wears headphones every day, as he watches films and you tube videos, and I watch tv.	These are very poor for the money.	These are
I am writing this review on my new Chromebook right now!	Easy set up, very fast, great images, and lasting battery life.	I bought this chromebook May 2018.	It might be supported in 2017, listed in Google's web site.	The only problem is that it crashes much more often then I would expect (It crashed during every Facebook Messenger Video Call I've done so far).	Bought this for my husband to replace his desktop PC
Had an issue with the geo-fencing feature where it kept saying the camera didn't have an internet connection - but I verified it did.	Arlo Q does that, and was a breeze to set up.	Great product so far!	Tech support has tried unsuccessfully.	I’m sorry, but this camera was absolutely terrible.	Will definitely be buying more!	One Arlo camera perfectly spans the distance from our rear entrance to our front entrance.	A joke, absolute
Of course, not all 4K content is created equal and some movies/shows are more impressive than others.	E model has had no issues.	This is my first 4k TV.	What I don't like is the slow processor.	Ethernet hardwired input is vey slow, on 200 mbs connection measured about 9 mbs using int browser and spectrum tools.	It made set up really difficult and I was only able to set it up as I had
The lens provided is perfect and retracts to a nice compact size for convenient travel.	I don't know if this camera came thru the grey market but it never worked properly or gave me very good pictures.	First of all I'd like to thank amazon.	Great camera and I am just beginning to learn the capabilities.	But I wanted a camera a bit more user friendly... and the 5300 is much better on that score.
Beats having the Geek guys come and charge $$$$ for porch speakers.	Sadly thats all the good I have to say about this speaker, as its primary function sucks.	I have three other Bose products so I am a little biased.	Two playing together in party mode are very impressive for their size.	Told me new software had to send back for repair so they could download software.	I love the Bose 360 as I
This was a gift for my son in law.	Heavy travelers may want to look elsewhere but for anyone else, these are perfect!	Everything sounds better through these phones.	Good, neutral sound, with a bit of a bass bump, but not much.	These guys are really comfortable to wear, block a lot of outside noise (they are not noise canceling).	In a quiet room you will not be disappointed and I am an audio sound
There's been no noticeable change in USB 3.0 access speed.	I use it daily at work, and it has been a trooper through it all.	Works great.	My desktop's front USB ports are broken.	All of them are probably going to work relatively well.	I almost ordered Velcro, I’m glad I did not as this hub came with a size cut piece that attached it perfectly to the base.	With that, it would be perfect.
Matches the same white as my Xbox and has a lot of space.	Now we can fit tons of games on our external hard Drive.	I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend.	Really needed with so many awesome games coming out.	My Xbox will no longer detect the external hard drive.	Not willing to try this product again.	Games kid fast and play without a problem.	The load times were still the same.
There isn't much difference between any of them.	I am so glad I had it.	I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED A CANON...	Super easy to take anywhere.	I also have larger digital cameras but this is one of my favorites.	Not as slinky as model after, steady in your hands, while taking pictures, just panarmic not as wide , as model after.	Good luck capturing the moment.	It seems to work good in low light and
Photo quality is great, though I recommend picking up another lens (this one is perfect for beginners like myself).	This'll distract her gor a while!	Better if you get the 50mm lens, a tripod, remote shutter, and of course a bag to keep it safe.	Came earlier than anticipated arrival date and with everything I could possibly need!	Very easy to use (better read the manual for ever detail).	It mounts the same lenses and
I don't really like it, wish I had bought a hanger style headphone mount.	I don't like this thing.	It's excellent.	The foam anti-slip pads they give you for the bottom fall off too easily and leave a very sticky residue on the bottom of the stand.	It helps me remember to actually put the headphones back when I'm done with them, and then I know exactly where they are the next time I want
Thanks great unit	Allows multiple users to all work without losing significant speed.	It seems to work ok, but I would not recommend it due to these quality control issues.	I have one at my home.	That's pretty cheesy and lame.	My is quiet.	Check the web and read forums carefully - this particular model drops wifi connections regularly with items like Samsung Galaxy S4 and iPads.	I connected another modem to the router though
Lousy board and lousy company to rush this crap out.	I've searched google and tried everything there to see at least bios screen, but didn't work.	Speed on.	This worked fine with the AMD AM4 processor I had laying around.	The reinforcement on the PCI helps to support heavy GPUs.	Also bois cant find any 3 pin fans and only the cpu fan connector 4 pin actually works.	I installed the Ryzen 5 1600 and
any thoughts	It's easy to use, scans documents quickly and the driver to upload scanned docs to other programs is simple and fast.	Doesn't look like it would hold up to lots of abuse.	scans amazingly compared to our Neat scanner.	We are constantly scanning everything from Home Depot receipts, to thick 2-sided full-color booklets.	Using the program is not exactly user-dumb but eventually I caught on.	Even with its slow mode, still managed to
I got the VIP3 accessory to go with this keyboard, and use that at the middle (10 degree) setting.	Turns out it's a great product.	The split is a great idea, and it really helped my hunched shoulders and tight chest muscles.	They were too deep to type fast.	Can set one on each arm of my recliner if I wanted.	Think twice before buying this expensive and ineffective product.	I own two for home
I haven’t had any issue fitting everything I had and then some.	My son uses it every we go if it’s on vacation.	Perfect spots for all the accessories and tons of slots for the games.	This product is very nice if you are traveling with your switch to a friends house or hotel.	The case is otherwise perfect for packing pretty much everything.	Almost perfect, but still good enough for five stars.	I bought
This 1st Gen chip will last me many years to come.	Handles anything and everything and can render a HD video at 60fps of the highest quality in a matter of a few minutes.	I love these new gen tech.	Performs well when multitasking.	Great for a mid range gaming rig or everyday use.	It seems a few people did not and are leaving bad reviews because they didn't know this cpu doesn't come with
I gave one pair to my best friend.	I read all the great reviews here which prompted me to pick these binoculars for an upcoming trip to see wildlife.	I use them for bird watching and have not been disappointed.	The quality seems great for the price.	I will be using these for hunting and the small binoculars will be a perfect fit to pack in my bag.	Our 12 yr old got these for
I was nervous about buying this due to the number of reviews which say they had problems setting it up but am pleased to report we found this super easy to set up.	I put the GPS coordinates that were on the webpage but it didn't give me the correct point.	I will buy a Garmin.	Traffic updates do not work with IOS 13.	We have very slow wifi and it still dowloaded them very
That’s info for all the plant growers though.	I am very happy with the build quality of this device, strong durable plastic and the buttons are made of a very nice rubber feels solid when pushed.	Use this to calculate my placement of orchids in their growing area.	Using this to go cube to cube showed that the meter was so useful and the variation by seating area was real!!!	Good device to read different
The camera works fine, I get that I bought a used but it would've been nice to know that then camera won't charge using the micro USB.	If you are on the fence, do it.	Very unreliable and the camera has even been recalled in japan from what some people were saying.	Supposed to Ravenscroft warranty but does not.	I am just blown away by the detail this little camera picks up.	Macro photography only
I GAVE TWO AWAY AS GIFTS TO FRIENDS.	No, but it is a great little knock-around that is easy to carry, easy to use, and doubles as a hand-held commercial FM radio if I need to check the news, listen to some music, or listen to some advertising.	Get the extended batteries.	Easy to program and use.	Despite the clutter of homes and factories in my area, this unit still connects with my other BaoFengs
I unplug it in the AM, after I copy the image stored that previous night.	I used it on my Mac as the Time Machine backup destination.	I had no idea this product was so slim, the looks of it is really nice.	Shame on me for not buying the protection, I guess.	I have dropped it few times, still working.	These drives will not last for ever, but for computer backup or console storage,
Expected much better.	Establishing a connection between two Bluetooth devices.	They stay in even when running.	Very easy to sync to APPLE products, a little tricky when you sync with ANDROID but I got them to sync.	Comfort was ok, and it had a decent seal .	So much better than my air pods.	I found the second largest give me the best bass.	They weren't for me though and I sent them back.	I
Best choice I've made.	I've been eyeballing this camera for years and it has proven to be even better than expected.	I like manual control and find the dials on this camera very easy to understand and use.	Great camera.	Switched over from Nikon.	Way more photo power than I need.	Not really suitable for a family, only a enthusiast with some training.	Saving my pennies.	In looking for a small light weight camera to
We were very excited to get our new TV however when it came the box was damaged on both sides with large gashes ( I have pictures).	It's hard to hear and you have to turn it up to 45-50 to hear some channels.	Paying this much for a tv I can’t even use half the time is just devastating.	Set up was easy and fairly quick.	The setup was exhilarating.	Since changing that power
Getting just the body gives you choices as to what lens set up you want to use.	Love the photos I made with it.	Sometimes it creates a funny color effect on the pictures.	Takes amazing pictures.	For the price, this camera is everything you would need to begin your photography hobby.	Got a lot of positive comments on the color too.	This is my first Digital SLR and I am very pleased with it.
Don’t waste your time with this unit if you aren’t comfortable running the open source Asuswrt-Merlin firmware.	Doesn't beat tp-link or netgear.	I debated buying anything over 80 dollars insisting that the routers that had five stars at that price range were sufficient.	Too big and cumbersome with awkward antenna positions.	This performs well even around corners and through walls.	Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money, and avoid Asus entirely.	Just go into
I love this product because it's large.	This was an excellent purchase.	Quailty bag.	I really like this messenger bag.	Love this!	I bought for my husband and loved it at first.	My only concern is that I bought the large size and it seems smaller than I expected.	I can easily fit two textbooks, notepad and my 11" chromebook, with room to spare.	Definitely a great investment.	Ordered this for my daughter, wish I
Easy to wire.	I have these in a 2.1 setup powered by a 100W receiver.	I use these in my office a they work very very good.	Did make a difference after sound calibration.	Much better than the more expensive speakers I replaced.	Easy to install.	I like them so much, I bought a second pair after the sale went off.	I highly recommend spending 2x the money and buying JBL of Klipsch.	I have
I tried but could not find a way to adjust the color settings on the laptop.	I feel it is slightly overpriced, but maybe that’s just my own opinion.	It is very fast, the screen is fantastic.	PC battery drains within 5 hours after it is fully charged.	I tried to replace or return, and only God knows where they are now.	This is NOT using it for watching movies or all day use.	Great
Very nice to be downstairs and be able to preheat the bed upstairs.	Too much current draw?	My heater, lava lamp, humidifier and mosquito catcher are all hooked up to it.	I will be buying more as needed.	After moving, I can not get it to connect to the WiFi.	I was very pleased with the device until it stopped working.	I have three in my home.	But it works, and I love it.	I
The digital coaxial doesnt work and you are left with the headphones connector as output.	The best part is that we only watch this TV when we watch a movie.	Pretty upsetting.	The picture is supreme.	Too bad - so much potential!	The picture is fantastic.	they work very well.	Comes with HDMI cable.	Maybe it's a good TV but not a good monitor.	No regrets other than the tuner.	It's been tested with different
Would not always reconnect and never for more than a minute.	When I bought this computer it seemed to already have a virus, which I had to pay to have cleaned up.	It had Norton and Dropbox offers on it at boot.	Product as advertised.	Very economical computer.	The price was also very agreeable.	I bought it in October 2019.	bought alone, they would be $200 or $300 but because it's packaged and retail in
Removed packing tape(s), loaded paper tray, installed ink and followed the on screen prompts for setup.	My spouse had no trouble printing wirelessly from a pc in the other room...	The actual price of this printer is reasonable.	I found this one and I have to say it is pretty nice.	Quick Book/Intuit users - DO NOT BUY!!	Faxes and scans just as great.	I just installed this printer.	This is a thousand times better
After using this drive for a while now, I recommend and use it as well for any external solution from your mac mini to your co-located server.	I won't return it because it is not worth the effort.	It's so sad that laptops don't really have disk drives anymore.	Easy to install and works like a charm!	At least it gets the job done (though at a painfully slow pace).	I was so excited to
Overall this is a great product.	Great buy and saved me a monthly modem rental from Xfinity and did not even use a tech to install this product!	We're also gamers and this guy allows us to play MMO's without issue.	wifi connected for about 15 minutes then disconnected... like wtf LMFAO.	I had to call cox to connect this one since it will not do it automatically online through the install process.	Installed it
- Power button is on the top so its easier to turn on compared to the first which has it on the back.	You'd think they'd be as easy as turn on and use.	Although any dance track is amazing out of these.	Now, only one of them is working properly.	Similar in size to the JBL.	Great for the money.	this is greate speaker.	Maybe this is why Anker/Soundcore opted to show photos of
Ended up sending back as the little extra bit of lows and volume did not make up the size of the unit.	Very nice!	One thing to note and to keep an eye on is the price....	I have a small room with some small bookshelf speakers.	But when listen to music you need set the volume be over half then you can feel difference.	Basically my receiver was auto-shutting off because the speakers couldn't
I have seen many other reviews describing rusting or hard to clean and these comments in my mind are unaware how to use/clean stainless steel pots and pans.	A listing on Amazon would have helped.	Toss them in the dishwasher, use any utensil you want.	They were well worth the money spent!	These pieces are heavy !	Upgraded to these and very happy!	Not only is this set very stylish and aesthetically appealing, it also
It falls apart constantly.	I also bought the hand vac model with the same battery.	Price is steep but after my frustration wit $400.	When did appliances become so disposable?	It easy to empty without getting your hands dirty.	I loved it at first but the third time I used it the suction stopped working.	We got it for quick clean ups in the kitchen.	Battery lasts long enough to get at least two or
I’ve used this for multiple dinners now and each time it’s taken me just minutes to clean it and put it away.	We love this product and use it weekly.	Clean up was fast and efficient with plates being easy to take off and put back on.	Bacon, steak, pancakes burgers ... I’ve tried lots of things to cook in it ... and it all comes out good!	Bought this second one for my rental
But it works perfectly and you can just wipe it down with a wet cloth and it’s good to go.	This product is a life saver.	It has no temperature control.	LOVE IT!	Also love how easy it is to clean.	Good panini press... only wish they put a on/off switch on it instead of plugging and unplugging constantly.	Like it a lot .	It makes sandwiches SO delicious, we choose that over going out
Totally happy with the purchase and helps me keep my bath room organized.	Kids like it.	Has not fallen down since.	The design is just awesome and holds so many things while keeping your toothbrush covered but allows it to dry.	It holds all of our toothbrushes and toothpaste and the little cups are super handy; I really like that they keep the toothbrushes from getting dusty as we roll down the road!	It also
The microwave still was working well.	LOVE IT!	Don't waste your money on an Emerson product.	This oven also has a conventional heating component and came with a metal grill accessory.	Shipped it back.	This is my second microwave (EXACT ONE) and I really love this product.	I love the microwave a lot!	Cooks very well.	Seems like it would splatter all over the oven...	As a microwave oven, it would do anything a microwave
Have had mine for months now and adore it!!	Seems to be a great value for the money.	I still use them everyday.	Once understood, it's a lovely addition to my kitchen.	I gave them to my daughter as a housewarming gift.	they're beautiful to look at!!	The copper darkens a bit during cooking, but it comes right back with a quick swipe of copper cream.	So far, I like them....nice weight to them a
Also looks great for a corporate office setting	This has proven to be a good purchase.	It holds a very good temperature.	This mini-fridge is quite large inside.	Keeps my drinks cold and what little food I have in there is cold.	Even on high it only will keep frozen what was already frozen.	Stays super cold, drinks are perfect and freezer is amazing too.	It has a nice sized freezer and plenty of space
I have one for my bed and my kids beds.	soft to the touch, fits nicely on a Tuft&Needle Queen.	The great thing about this protector is that it is waterproof.	You won't even know it's on.	Rec'd the sheets and it is just as comfortable.......The ONLY problem is getting OUT of the bed!!!!!!!!!!!!	It has high-quality stretchy sides that allowed it to easily cover our extra-deep queen-size mattress.	I highly recommend this product!	We
I just put my two bookcases together over this past weekend and I love the look of them.	Either way, that kind of damage may indicate quality of item.	The outer box seemed fine but a corner was missing from one of the shelves, and I found the missing corner inside the box.	It has plenty of surface space for monitors, keyboard, mouse, joystick and other junk.	It looks great in my office at home.
It was like sleeping on a wooden floor.	This mattress has not sagged or changed its shape.	Seems like a high quality mattress.	Give it a couple of days for you to adjust and you won't be disappointed.	After 10+ years sleeping on a temerpedic mattress I was worried these would be too soft or mushy.	Oh my god the most comfortable bed I have ever had.	It was easier for me to order a
Not any more.	Came in the box was excited to use it but it didn't work.	The basket is great and helps me not burn myself from being clumsy.	Love how this one drains the oil and it is so easy to then wipe the debris off the bottom with a paper towel.	They need to fix that issue.	Plastic in general is is considered to release toxic gas when heated.	Very disappointing indeed.	Looking
The "lock" feature enables upright storage.	This appliance is easy to use and clean and fun to use.	After reading a lot of reviews of various panini makers, I chose the Breville and I'm glad I did.	it will forever change the way you make sandwiches.	Otherwise, it doesn't take long to heat up, sandwiches are nicely browned without using oil or butter, and the contents are hot.	The pizza tastes just as good as
Well it may be if you are single and do not have a robust bedroom life.	It slides on my concrete floor.	It does not shake or exhibit any instability.	I purchased this item in order to raise my bed a little higher.	Not sure it would do that for very long however.	Solid/Sturdy and no squeaking, weight limit is awesome.	Easy to assemble with included tool.	It almost appears that we may have gotten
i'm disappointed with the quality of the maker.	the only gripe I have with it is the price.	Needs constant tending to get best water distribution without overflow.	Excellent coffee maker.	Well, it's a great machine.	Main reason for keeping was the consistent brew.	but it is a very minor inconvenience for a great cup of coffee every morning.	Nothing special about the coffee, temperature or experience.	The fist cup was perfect but afterwards the
It sits on my quilt table next to my sewing machine and it is perfect for piecing!	Iron cord is around 54" long which is great!	And promptly returned it.	It is easy to pack and take along.	I doubt I'd want to use it for ironing a whole shirt or pair of pants, but it's been exactly what I needed for steam-pressing quilt blocks and doing quick touch-ups to my kids' clothes.	It is
Go figure, right?	Wouldn’t buy again.	This crock pot has served me well the last year or so, however there is one small issue.	You had to be back at a certain time to turn it to warm, so we exchanged it for this one.	How could I go wrong?	Perfect gift for this family on the go.	Absolutely the WORST Crock Pot I have ever owned and I have had many!	When you open
This was purchased to replace an old microwave in our break room at work.	H Richardson MD	If it lasts two years, like our most recent microwave, we will feel cheated.	Not worth the money for the duration.	Should be easier to use, less pressing of buttons especially for commercial use.	It has no weak motor turning a platter that gets dirty underneath.	It's another button that does the same.	Oh yea!!	Worth It I
Suction is good.	Air vent blows from front but is angled up.	Easy to assemble - comes in 3 pieces.	I have never been this mislead by amazon reviews!	I have been a swifter dry for a long time since they pick up so much, but this is easier and more efficient.	I highly recommend this product!	Now she has one also :).	It is NOT INTENDED for rugs or carpets, but it is light
It is easily cleaned.	I would definitely recommend this!	The splash guard is a definite plus.	Cleans up really good in dishwasher.	How I never had this cooking tool until age 40 is beyond me.	Perhaps a pit wasn't right in the center and when punched the seed was to the side in the cherry or got pushed into the meat elsewhere.	I have two of these (thought I lost one so I bought another)
Even though I've only had them for a few days, they are working perfectly.	If you have a king bed, you need six of these not four!!	Got them for college and they have held up my big, heavy, bulky bed all semester with no problem!	It took a couple of nights to get used to it, but this angle actually seems to help, and much more comfortable than those wedge-type pillows.	But also doing
VERY easy to clean though, which is great.	And of course, his favorite brand is Dunkin' Donuts.	He was impressed with the machine, ease of set-up, clean-up, and overall use.	This is my second one, I loved the first one so much!	Environmental friendly too, no plastic waste.	Hard to see inside too.	I actually returned mine thinking it was defective, but the replacement was the same.	Spend your money on a more reliable product!
No longer is my rice sacrificing itself for me only to end up burned and not fulfilling its duties.	I am an older cook I began to forget food on stove, which is not unusual as we age.	It does help greatly if you rinse you rice thoroughly until the water is clear.	I’ll set it and forget it to automatically keep it warm and even a while after it’s done cooking the rice is
Multiple was to stand or store.	I love it and it's so nice that the handle gets longer or shorter depending on our needs!	I'm down for anything that makes cleaning easier.	I received this broom and dustpan today.	The extendable broom doesn’t work at all.	The teeth in the dust pan work so well and the dust pan doesn't leave that line of dust behind.	Also, I would have liked a wider angle broom
This comes in great shape, washes well and holds up.	I would recommend this mattress pad.	It doesn't add a lot of cushion, but I didn't expect it to after reading reviews.	I'm using it on a bed for an Airbnb so will need to replace it fairly often, and it is good for that.	This mattress pad is great.	As soon as I opened it, I ironed it and put it on the bed.
MUCH better.	mess) every 20 minutes.	drip pan I bought is a big plus keeps down the mess	To the point that I worry about someone getting a contact burn.	The only thing I don't like is that the rubberized feet come out if they happen to stick to something.	Easy to use and clean.	Not a problem, just a helpful hint!	Great coffee maker!	It is used every day and seems to do the
The blue is like a pale navy or slate blue.	I have my own skincare line so I have a LOT of ingredients that I have had on a huge gnarly bakers rack in my kitchen.	Not this piece, it looks excellent next to my vintage furniture.	It would be better if the little drawers pulled out smoothly but I can overlook for the price.	When putting this together I found that the holes don't
As some reviewers have mentioned, it is a rather loud fan.	It's not heavy so I take it room to room with me on hot days.	Works very well to cool down a small room in little time.	Not true.	Great fan for the value.	**No tools needed to assemble it.	Not sure if she will be able to use it.	Does it move air?	On the downside (outside of the motor and cord) all
Would definitely recommend it!	& of course, it suggested a Dehumidifier!	That really helps!	It's the worst item I ever bought on Amazon.	I used it in my bathroom and turn it on every night after shower to reduce moisture from the towel and from the bathroom.	So, I don't leave it on for hours at a time.	Also, there's been no unpleasant odor since I plugged it in.	Here in the Midwest, it's pretty
I like the cover to keep the smell out.	I bought several sets and use for frozen lemonade, juices, fruit purée.	Who would have thought that I would need directions to operate an ice cube tray!	Unlike my old ice cub trays, the ice cubes come out easily and in one piece!	I had one tray left of the three, because they broke.	Keep in mind these are small and it takes a lot to
It's definitely worth the buy.	I got the pan yesterday and couldn't wait to use it!	Makes great dual edge brownies.	No more hard, burnt edges with gooey centers.	Whoever invented it should be inducted to the Baking Hall of Fame.	From brownies and cakes to casseroles, Baker’s Edge does it all.	Maybe I used the wrong butter but overall a good pan to have as a kitchen tool.	I have wanted this pan for
And I used it to bake my chicken thighs at high heat and the rack delivered its promise.	If you pair it with a half-sheet pan, it works perfectly	It arrived on time and will be very useful when I need a cooling rack for when I'm baking.	(I bake 4-6 loaves of a dense fruit n nut oatmeal bread at a time and this large rack can cool all 6)	I am very happy
I really wish the "made in Taiwan" sticker was on the box, not the glass.	The spout does look kinda delicate so I would be careful not to bump it.	Bonus that this is easy to clean and see though.	This is a nice little kettle.	very well made and will work well	Comes with metallic ring for electric stoves.	I know for certain that it is clean and ready for use.	After a few
Works very well for kids and takes up minimal space.	But the other side is fine.	My 10 year old granddaughter never felt save on it.	I even chose not to attach the side brackets and it still works great.	The ladder is unusable.	Wouldn’t buy again.	Took 3 hrs with 2 crazy kids plus making dinner to put together.	Sturdy enough for 4 year old to grow into and stay in as he gets
There have been absolutely no problems with the single serve side, using K cups or the basket and capsule, using my owns grounds.	The first time I used it I thought that it was great since I could use my kcups, I loved that feature and that seemed to work flawlessly.	This is the third one we tried and they are all the same, one was even worst.	Also has strength selector.	just a pain
Adjustable temperature also great.	Dries things out evenly.	I'm just happy that I order the larger model.	I am enjoying the Excalibur food dehydrator.	My last batch of jerky got super dried out and did not shut off when expected.	Easy to use and clean.	Jerky is a big win as well.	The only thing that I can say is a dislike ( which really has nothing to do with the machine) is that there
I bought it to replace an older aircon unit that I had for years.	The sleep mode doesn't do anything as far as I can tell.	I used it last summer and was very disappointed.	However nice cold air to cool the room.	It is extremely well made and of a good quality plastic.	However, I needed to buy an extension hose to move the unit further indoors.	A perfect air conditioner for cooling down
Must buy	This is much faster, much easier, and doesn't jam.	I highly recommend this product!	to expensive to return.	I got it and sent it back the very same day.	It works really well, I only had one minor issue that was easily resolved.	Would definitely recommend.	Stuffed sausage and pepper sticks.	Sausage stays chunky and isn't turned to mush or ground too fine after going through the grinder a second time.	I stuffed
I use it with the cleaner and have been very happy with the results.	Still need to do a few more coats but so far , huge improvement.	I have mopped a few times too and they kept the shine.	Leaves streaks on my hard wood floor !!	Not too hard to use either.	The finish lasts too!	Excellent job on my hardwood floors.	I have tried countless types of hardwood floor shiners, but this
One of them broker after two months of LIGHT use and with not grind anything.	Overall great product.	Very functional and pretty!	I would definitely recommend these for the price/quality ratio.	And yes I have cleaned it out.	And no more having to store my grinders on a dish because of loose salt and pepper falling out, really so much cleaner to store.	they have been very durable and look like the day we purchased
Needed it for light items such as books.	Was able to put it together without so much as a screwdriver.	Looks so cute behind my computers at work!	Glad I chose them!	I thought everything was very well thought out and it is a great product.	Very happy with this stand.	It not the strong shelf in the world but it does the work.	Helps add greenery in her tiny space.	I put it together
You may want to get a holder that can support the decanter upside-down while it dries.	It is both beautiful and effective.	No where in the product details does it indicate that it is not included.	Does it improve the taste?	Finally, it's handsome.	It really smooths out the wine as you go.	This is a perfect decanter, it has a classy and elegant look for any occasion!	But it's far easier to pour.	Very
It was mostly ripped off when it was delivered.	I am a very light sleeper and for the first time in my life, my husband can get out of bed without waking me!	We bought this mattress 7 months ago and I read lots of reviews prior to buying it and this was by far the best value!	A very comfy mattress.	We have been sleeping on it for just about a week and a
The water tank is large, etc.	Other than that I love the iron.	The iron may seem a bit heavy at first use, but I've gotten use to the weight of it after many uses.	I moved the iron for the picture so one could see the extent of the leakage.	I totally recommend the Rowena Steamforce iron.	Temperature setting only lights up to wool indicator.	It was returnable until like 7/31/19 and it broke
I like these a lot.	Works GREAT for condensed soup cans, veggie cans, mini mushroom cans and mini juice cans.	great product.	I plan on getting several more to connect together once I can save up for them!	The unit is pretty much as pictured and the cans fit and move pretty well only hanging up a few times.	I bought two and 1 and 1/2 fit in my largest cabinet.	LOVE IT!	Will be
All different sized pots and pans to choose from.	All the items are good with the exception of the pans the leaks fluid where the rivets are at the handle.	I just graduated so am populating my new kitchen with starter sets of everything.	I was so sad.	Pots and Pans are good.	Spend a little more on something that wont break within 3 months!	I feel like I will break the spatula if I
I highly recommend this product!	A spiralizer was featured in a cookbook and sounded like it would make cooking this way easier.	Haven't had a chance to find out what they think of it.	It does create a core when you do it, which is probably what they all do.	I used it with a zucchini and the noodles were delicious.	My family loved the vegetable noodles and I can't wait to some of the
I love them and all my guests see them and love them too.	This is our second purchase.	I would recommend it!	We like to quickly chill them in the fridge with ice and water and then serve cosmopolitans in them.	But have used them with cold and like them a lot.	They were given to me as a gift and I have to say they are now my favorite gift from Christmas.	This did
I was impressed .	I put it to use tonight.	I like the fact that there are 2 of them because my wife can use one and I can use the other at the same time.	I know this will work well as a chopping board.	I see these lasting me a very long time.	This bamboo butcher block is EXACTLY what I was wanting.	Other than that, it's okay!	I doubt these will break
So you can't nest this in the 2 qt.	Worth the investment if you like to cook.	I love All Clad - Made in America!!!	They are nice looking and will enjoy them for ever.In my life I cannot tell you how many different pots I have owned.	The pan costs a lot but it works great.	Also the handle is too long and uncomfortable for every day use.	They didn't disappoint.	It heats up
I bought these boots for a cross country trip last summer.	However, I ordered a size smaller and just shipped back the other ones.	I can confirm they are true to size, but if you are in between sizes and fluctuate, pick the larger size.	They aren't great for casual wear.	Advice: take some time to truly break-in, wear 2 pair of wool socks (saved me from additional damage), lace for comfort (I'm still learning
The sneakers for the price are great!	And the best thing is that it weighs very light, and that it supports ankles , and that it makes me feel safe to jump.	They are well made.	My only criticism is that if you like a soft insole, these are more typical dress of a shoe, If you intend to spend significant time on your feet.	fit great.	So comfortable, with the high ankle support, that
They are most comfortable and hug the foot .	These shoes are very flattery to my somewhat wide feet.	Will buy other colors.	They seem to have some normal padding of maybe 1/3 inch but nothing I feel like memory foam.	The soft flexible upper is perfect for accommodating my bunion brace.	Loved this but unfortunately it was not wide enough.	I bought it in Navy and I'm going to get another color - I
The left shoe is fine, the right shoe appears to be glued in a slightly different spot making them fit differently and the leather on the inside of the right shoe is very rough while the left is not.	With a family full of Sperry Topsider lovers, it's about all about the deal.	A nice fun plus was the tartan plaid lining -- cool-looking and comfortable.	I thought I needed the wide ones but didn’t
Pretty sure these are fake.	uggs 6 is like a 8 in womans.	Be aware that it's not a 'real' UGG product so you are paying a lot for a faux sheepskin moccasin.	They are super warm and fuzzy.	These are so warm and comfy.	They are so cozy, comfy and fit perfectly.	I am normally a women's size 8 and purchased the 6Y and they fit perfectly!	Soooooo comfy!	She lived in them this
I would normally sacrifice looks for comfort (and sometimes vice versa), but these shoes are meh on both fronts.	I bought this pair for a back up when I wear my first pair out!	I would’ve given the shoe five stars but since the size was not true to fit I had to get a four	These fit nice but for some reason these just have not held up well.	They fit to size perfectly,
These are very comfortable right out the box.	She is not a bias person or an UGGS fanatic but the UGGS are more comfortable.	The price was perfect.	These are great for a day of shopping or for walking around New York in the fall.	This boot is good quality and very warm.	I got the sand color, I think next time I will get a darker color because this color stains easily.	I purchased
The shoe wears well.	Will update my review in a few more weeks.	It's more like a pink.	I would rate them five stars, except they look a little strange when looking down, on the inside of my feet.	It's a bargain for $45 and my $80 black Asics mom's walking shoes will be banished to car trunk for emergency purpose.	these look good in the picture, but upon receiving the materials are cheap and
Only drawback is they're starting to fall apart after a couple weeks!	This is a great shoe.	These are very comfortable aalking shoes.	Absorbs a lot of heel impact especially if you’re flat footed like me.	These are the most comfortable shoes.	Beyond the super cool design, is a comfortable fit, ultra light weight, durable sneaker, perfect for running, working out or out on a casual hangout.	Big guys need wider fits my husband told
The color is nice and goes with so many attires.	There is enough room for the toes even though the front has a point.	High heel, but slightly cushioned instep.	Lovely shoe.	The wide ended up being too loose.	One of the best pair of shoes ever!!!!	The heel wore off after wearing the shoes 4 times.	Easy to put on as it has a little elastic stretch section on the side docent come off
Very durable and fit perfect!	ASICS are pretty consistent on their shoe size.	That said, I have not exerted them in extreme use.	My husband says that these are by far the most comfortable shoes he has ever owned.	Used for walking, not running.	These arrived new in box.	I don't run but for lots of walking and standing, these are great shoes!	No problem with these shoes!	My only complaint is the fact it
Not as bright white as I had expected.	Feels like a pair of work boots.	I got these because my other shoes were on their last legs and was thinking it would be cool to have a pair of trainers.	He loves them!	Puma is still a great brand and product.	Thank you so much.	Just but these shoes they are so beautiful and very good price.	I hadn't worn Puma's in years...	Very happy
My old hiking boots finally bit the dust and good riddance!	Used the boots right from the box for a 3 day backpacking trip over 21 miles.	I ordered 1/2 size up and with good quality hiking socks they fit perfect.	They are amazingly light but supportive at the same time; it is like walking on air.	Even bought another pair for the misses.	The materials and construction were on point, but the sizing seems
This is the third pair that we have purchased for our son who is now nearly 5 years old.	We purchased these for my toddler granddaughter who has very wide feet and a high arch.	They seem a little heavy but she never complained.	These are slightly wide shoes, which has been great for his feet.	Heavier then his sneakers, but he can run and play comfortably.	He loves them and can put them on
asked for a replacement pair... the one the second pair the right boot leaked.	Well made and attractive.	Somewhat narrow, particularly in toe box.	(Probably not till August.)	I know I will buy again.	Completely waterproof after a years use.	These boots gripped the ground like a Sherman Tank.	I can go in deep water all the way to the top of the boot and not get wet as long as water doesn't enter from
Their guidelines for sizing length and width are quite good.	Great shoe for support especially in the heel and arch.	We'll see how the soles hold up as that was the only negative on some of the previous reviews.	I like the brand for the consistency of size and product.	On my 4th pair.	It too bad I can’t retuen the item because by the time he was able to try it out the return
They would be perfect if they fit.	Got these and they were too small and nowhere near wide enough.	I was so happy with them I ordered 3 more pairs.	They don’t feel super comfortable and the flip flop does make a bit of noise when I walk in them.	They are very light.	Very soft on the feet, supportive and very comfortable.	It appears these slides might run a little small in length; width
Looks to be soldid construction with slip resistant sole.	At the least another pair of boots and a gift certificate for a couple shirts or something.	If you like a little fore and aft room, they may be a little small.	Would give it five stars but it's too soon to say.	If you put the brand and size of another shoe you wear they will give you the size to buy these boots in.
a great shoe for winter wear.	I always order the same size and have never been disappointed by the fit.	It is a fine looking shoe.	These exceed my expectations.	But for kicking around, normal walking, etc, they're great.	Great fit, comfy and warm.	I have a wide foot and I never have problems with these shoes.	Perfect "mudders" or snow boots; but don't make her feet to warm to wear inside.	Around your angle
Now I have to return and wait for my normal size to come.	Had these sneakers only for a few months and they ripped!	However, there was a nail from the bottom that began to pierce through the inner lining of the shoe.	The only thing that she did not care for is the back somewhat lost it's ability to stand up when she puts them on and sometimes they "fold".	The colors are so
The fit is perfect and did not need to adjust my size.	I bought these shoes for Combat training and plyometrics.	They look great and feel great, too	They are perfect!	The price couldn't be beat!	That said, these shoes made a noticeable difference when I lift (I'm a newbie to cross fit).	These are by far my favorite athletic shoes ever!!!	Hopefully they'll fit.	Besides the bit-too-small size, this is a pretty solid shoe.
I've been happy with previous Adidas basketball shoes, but I can't buy them again after this experience.	But he does not play basketball in these shoes, sooo they lasted about a year before anything started peeling.	All-around solid pair of sneakers.	He loves them!	Overall we are happy with these shoes and ordered a seconds pair.	He has a really bad ankle that needs the support of high tops.	Price is great	Also ata reasonable
Great kid boots for a MN winter.	Kamik always a good buy!	They kept their socks drys.	This is our second pair as the kids of grown.	They last!	Solid sturdy kids boots for very reasonable price.	Good snow boots are very important.	We’ve been having a difficult time finding boots for my 10-year-old son.	Like all Kamik boots we have had, these are high quality and durable.	if you could fit your foot inside
They are perfect for our school uniforms, fit true to size and are comfortable for running around every day on the playground.	The 1.5W in this shoe is actually quite a bit narrower than the regular 1.5 See Kai Run shoe and much stiffer.	Bought this for my daughter, she loved it.	A pair of New Balance Extra Wides is comfortable, but this Stride Rite Extra Wide squeezes my feet like a vise.	Purchased these
These converse are for my 15 year old daughter as a gift.	Look amazing!	Also I didn't get invoice.	I’m normally a size 12, sometimes an 11.5.	Comfy, gorgeous colour, 2 colours of laces (rose gold and white).	She loves them.	It's my third pair but first leather converse.	Look great with jeans, leggings or little dresses.	I did not look at the small print as returns are not free and I had to pay
I originally ordered a size 10 but sent it back for a 9.5, my usual size.	This is not a running shoe, so it need not be so flat.	I-have several pair of sandals and boots.	Good width in the toes box, and you can adjust the straps quite a bit.	I am looking for a walking shoe but these are not sufficient.	They are still a bit loose.	Strap is not only too short
I was looking for something I could wear with skinny or straight leg jeans for a comfy casual look.	I decided to split the difference and ordered what should have been my normal size since I could return if wrong.	Once I added the orthotic and a thick sock, they fit just right.	I was so excited to order these boots, so when they arrived in my normal size and were HUGE I was bummed.
If you have a skinny foot/leg I’d recommend going a size down, and if you’re a half size, go down rather than up as these do run large!	She did not like the top of the boot since it is wider and does not fit her leg, but it is something that she can live with.	The boots are perfection!!!	Top of boots are sharp and hard.	I’ve wanted a pair of Hunters for years,
This is my third pair of 453 GTX.	The extra wide fit was absolutely needed for my wide feet.	Sole cracked on my other one sooner then expected.	Quality leather & front toe guard is very useful.	Actually comfortable right out of the box.	Took a week to break in but they are very comfortable.	My feet were dry and didn't hurt at all for them coming out of the box.	I knew these would
But these fit perfect and are so comfy.	Perfect color with jeans!	I have these in taupe and was waiting for the gray in my size.	The 8 fits great with a sock.	Due to the little holes you can even wear them in the summer time 😬 The style is classic.	These boots are just as expected, but I do think I'll love them more after I break them in.	These are the 5th
The insole it came with is junk, so buy a better one.	Leaving me unable to wear these boots 5 times a week as the pain becomes too much.	They're comfortable, they break in quickly, and they keep your feet safe.	It’s more than what I expected.	This pair is hard to wear even for a day without the squished structure of the boots digging into my foot and ankle.	Put the two of them
I do not want to return.	the colors look better in person and that's saying a lot.	They look really rice and offer really unique colorways.	Bulkier but not a bad shoe.	Maybe go half a size up if you choose to get these shoes.	Well built, I like the shoe.	Fit was perfect, color was perfect, everything was perfect.	The combination of shoe and laces are all day comfortable.	I'm wearing these as a
I seem to only wear FitFlop shoes any more.	These clogs has both!	Because of the thick and soft soles, I can stand all day without feeling tired.	Some of my friends got them in a few colors!	Returning for a replacement...	Lots of compliments.	These are GREAT shoes, but I have an extremely high arch & have a difficult time wearing clogs.	Fits perfectly and has the fit flip shoe bed.	Also, great delivery!
I would however recomend looking at the sizing chart.	They are beautiful!	Also it seems to be cheaply made.	But the sizing is completely off.	The heel was also the exact height I needed - not too tall to be uncomfortable or taller than my groom, but more sophisticated than a kitten heel.	Plus they came with free gel inserts, heel grips, and replacement heel tips.	The heel is not too high, but gives your
I need to wear custom orthodics and these boots fit them perfect.	My normal shoe size is 8.5 and I wear 8 D in this boot.	He loves them.	They are a little tight around the top of my foot but I expect they will loosen up over time as they get broken in.	When compared to the Justin water proof boots i now own you can see all the stitching where water can get
I wear an 81/2.	They don’t hurt My feet and really work	Matte navy blue.	Very comfortable.	The only problem I have with my rain boots is that they never fit correctly around my calves.	They keep my feet dry, which is worth the cost and they came more quickly than expected.	Returning and trying a different style.	They were the side strap style.	I didn't receive the boots as advertised, but I contacted the
Best water shoes I've ever had!	My second pair of this exact shoe!!	The mesh in upper toe allows sand to get inside your shoes however.	Love these shoes they fit great and don't give me blisters!!!!	Held up through a Spartan Race, which, in my opinion is the ultimate test for any shoe.	I already knew I loved Merrell shoes.	I have used them for walking, hiking and trail running, and they were up
Busted after a few months of use.	He loves them.	I use these boots everyday, I depend on them to get me through 10.5 hour work days.	If the toe lacing came loose after 7hrs from new, I'm not holding out too much hope on the remaining lacing that is functional...	He wore them on a 40 mile section hike of the AT with no problems, and no blisters.	Fit well.	They look nice on
Size wise it was true to size and I ordered size 3, but the fit on the feet itself was very weird being too wide at the top.	Ordered it for my son in size 13 (he is 5 years old with bug feet).	They seem a little narrow so if your child have wide feet, may not work or passably order a size up?	He loves wearing them.	My 9 yr old was irritated
They were very cute.	However, once on and you try to walk the rubber is so thick that it doesn't really bend.	Fit perfectly, completely waterproof.	They are lightweight and comfortable.	The awkwardness of walking in them goes away after you become accustomed to the boots.	Webpage advice was since these don't run in 1/2 size, then go down a size.	Would definitely buy another pair	Virtual Exchanges is a complete rip-off.	They are very
The soles take a bit of breaking in but that only took a week of walking around to do that.	Keep in mind the shoes were still brand new about a few days new😑 save your money.	NOT WATERPROOF, what a ridiculous claim, but they are DUST PROOF, which is actually more important.	But honestly, they were great.	Lace loop broke.	I plan to spray water repellant on it.	These boots are for my son
Comfort from day1.	He loves them.	These fit perfectly as if I bought them at a store.	I was definitely rewarded for giving Skechers a second chance.	I ordered a half size larger than my sneakers so I can wear good socks and they fit well.	I was hoping the noise would go away after a few rounds, but after 10 rounds they are as noisy as ever.	They are a bit on the heavy
The red and black color really popped.	Warm and dry and comfortable!	These are great boots, they fit great, look great, he loves them.	My daughter put these on and was ready to hike.	Toes are wearing kind of fast but that could just be my kid.	I purchased these boots for my 9 year old son to hike in this summer.	Loved these boots for a great trip to the mountains!	I will never.
Other than that, they have exceeded expectations!	Fit perfectly.	But for a 100.00 this is a quality shoe that will do the trick if you require cushion for high arches and plantar fasciitis.	I previously had the 19 model.	They were just ok. I’ve ran in the same style but was the men’s and for some reason the women’s aren’t near as cushy.	I have flat feet and supinate, but I like to run.	I
I love these 90s style platforms- they make an ordinary white shoe way more fun!	Been eyeing these for a while and finally bought them.	But until my wife can actually use a pair that fits they sit in their box in a closet as a bad purchase and therefore an unsatisfactory product.	The shoes does not bend with your foot very well due to the thick platform sole.	But very cute!	These are great
But it was good style and comfortable.	I already have some thigh high boots but wanted a flat boot because I knew I’d want total comfort along with looking cute some days .	Fit was good.	If you have thick legs or want a “slouch” look.	(not scrawny).	Also it feel as though the soles are cushioned which was a surprising plus.	They actually fit my legs perfectly.	Stretchy for knees & calves.	It fits
Not narrow and I have pretty average feet.	They were wayyyy to small.	Make sure you order a half size above your normal size.	Comfortable insole.	I’ve got wide feet.	These are nice, resonably priced summer shoes.	Lightweight and comfortable.	He's on his 4th pair of these, and he walks miles every day, and they lasted a long time.	Light and comfortable.	However for a cheap everyday shoe this is perfect.	They were delivered a
Bought half size up, because customers reported they run small.	They're the warmest boots I've ever owned.	I found this to be true.	Excellent quality, comfortable, insulation caused them to be tighter than normal Keen sizing I wear at the ball of the foot.	Awesome boots, well made, great wear and comfort, keep your feet warm	These things are amazingly warm and comfortable.	I find Keen boots to be durable, comfortable and worth the money.
He ordered his true size and is happy with them	I have bought many Asics shoes.	The length was fine, actually probably a little roomy, but the toe box was so tight I couldn't imagine working out and not having bad blisters on my toes.	This isnt pictured so it was dissapointing to receive them and see this ugly grey... whoever approved this design needs to approve their resignation.	I got a blister on a
They're high top sneakers that look like hiking boots.	Excited to see what they can do.	After about 4 months of use I really like these boots.	Then did a 10 mile hike and got caught in rain.	These were comfortable out of the box.	I found that exact boot in this model.	I walked in these about 10 miles before hiking to break them in a little bit.	The leather is just a thin
I have an iPhone so I cannot reply to a message but the messages that come across the screen are very clear.	Absolutely drop dead darling!!!	I'm so glad I invested in my fitness with this watch.	Love that I can read a text while walking.	I am working with Fitbit to try and resolve the issues but time will tell if I get any satisfaction.	I like that my notifications show and I can
I thought I would tear it or harm the phone, but after a few insertions I discovered how to slide it in effortlessly.	The phone stays secure and I forget I have this on.	I usually put my cell phone and keys in there and don't even notice it while I'm jogging.	Overall I'm very happy with the product, it holds my phone which is a large in one pocket and keys and honey drops
Very thick heavy duty plastic.	Its a perfect fit for places (stadiums, museums) that only allow certain measurment clear bags.	Actually, it was a little better (better made) than I had expected.	Minus one star.	Then it came out from the seam when leaving the game, causing me to put the strap inside and attempting to keep it on my shoulder while trying to exit a packed NFL stadium.	Using the larger strap, you can
So far they haven’t said anything negative shot it, so I’m assuming it works.	The spring and metal pieces are broken and thus I can't even close the umbrella!	My problem is that water seeps through the seams and you will get wet.	I didn’t realize how huge this is!	fortunately i could glue it back.	I like how it keeps me dry when it’s rainy outside.	I hope this one works better.	Has a
I bought this for my grandson three years ago and he plays with it every time he comes over.	Although they are very sweet and let her play with them, she never makes a basket.	We bought him the real basketballs(the small size) and it has worked well.	The height adjustment is the best part.	Its a lot bigger than I expected, Its for my 4 year old for Christmas so I haven't opened it
Held up well through 2 nights of pretty strong winds and rain.	This is a really good sized tent!	Kept the rain out.	We also liked the fact that this tent kept everything dry even when someone touched the side.	Love the out swinging door.	I finally got to use it and found a couple of holes in it and a few of the stakes were bent.	Could not pack it back into its carrying
It rained during the camping trip and the boys stayed nice and dry in their tent.	Dont expect the lightweight of a backpacking tent.	Just be careful entering and exiting, the door flap falls in and drips water everywhere.	I'm not sure why.	If it’s used during the winter definitely use the rain fly as the tent only has screen on the sides.	It rained heavily on Saturday night and throughout Sunday, and everything inside
It said don't put pots on grill and I didn't.	My only complaint is that if you accidentally bump the wind protectors inward, the whole lid collapses and falls back.	I am not returning because I am leaving for vacation and have no time.	It’s either high or higher.	If you are looking for something more portable and lightweight...checkout Jetboil systems but they are a lot more expensive.	It heats things up quickly and evenly.
It is heavy enough to be stable, but not difficult to move with the built in wheels.	I bought this one for my wife to match mine.	The wheels are somewhat cheap and make the process of moving the bench more tedious than the more expensive version, but for my needs, this is worth the lower price.	Proper pad height and variety of incline positions.	I’m not rating the bowflex bench because I didn’t receive
The package arrived damaged.	This bike is great.	Comfortable and love the features such as showing mileage and the amount of calories used.	I do have to mention as others have the exclusion of the charger is annoying, but manageable.	Have not had it long, but so far it seems great!	Overall I am very satisfied with the product.	Good bike don't give me wrong.	My husband easily assembled the bike with no problems.	Been
only reason it didn't receive a 5 was because there were 4 washers missing.	Works great use it almost every day.	Really good quality I'm surprised I spent so little on it.	As I was assembling this rack I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the materials.	For the weight I'm lifting right now, it's more than adequate.	It doesn't sway or slide, very sturdy.	Amazon directs me to CAP's customer service page.	Solid
I don;t think I'll destroy these any time soon, but beyond durability these will make me feel more confident.	Husband lifts weights.	Quality has just really gone down hill.	And they look fantastic!	They're thick and made of leather with rubber cushioning.	See attached video for more details.	Item is very snug so as the description say of you are in between sizes get next size up, so I would suggest if you are with
The color is so vibrant.	The error was, mine to not read the lines below, I let myself be carried away by the image, but I do not think that image is coincidence.	This ball doesn’t.	Came deflated which was great as I was mailing it out.	The colors are bright and easy to see in less than ideal light.	Nice product!	Bought this ball for Salvation Army gift for a girl tween.	Thought it
Aloha, al	I wasted a lot of money buying all the other mask when I should of gotten this one from the start, I would of saved more in the long run......	Never fogs up and it's easy to clean.	Get it now!	Looking forward to using it!	This is a great investment no type of fog whats so ever and easy too clean	Excellent field of view, light weight, yet sturdy design.	Totally worth
Know your heart rate at a glace and with Smartphone App.	I moved from the Vivosmart to the the Vivosmart HR.	The watch is fairly unresponsive and tells me to move while I'm out for a walk.	Had I known the “deep Purple” was not true to color described or pictured, I’d purchased black.	Doubles as safety gear!	Have had it only 2 months (not worn everyday either) and screen already cracked.	Heart Rate measurement
Maybe the whit one and the grey one are the same?	They sent me the discontinued piece of sh&*, and not the BUP542-1 (I guess they look alike?	Buy any other radar gun even if it is more expensive.	Save your money	Stopped working properly with 2nd use.	It works really nice.	We have a lot of fun with this!	I sit on a bucket and catch her with the gun in my right hand,
I purchased this bike from Amazon 1 year ago.	I've been using this exercise bike for roughly 8 months.	This item was dumped at a locked building anyone could have taken.	Quite surprising.	Excellent value, all I have to do is use it!	Biggest disappointment was a rather bad odor that it has.	Took about an hour to put together with help.	Quiet and easy to program, easy to mount and dismount.	Recommend it.	The
They are padded in all the right places.	This is my second pair of these gloves.	I have bought Franklin gloves before and always found them well built and durable.	I use them for slow-pitch softball and it has completely eliminated the aftershock effect of making a hit.	I like these a lot.	It was my fault.	I'm 5'8", slim, with normal sized hands (not very helpful), 140lbs.	My 12 yr old says he feels
It slows drastically when it gets off paved surfaces.	Came already assembled from Razor/Amazon.	Definitely need a helmut and more supervision due to 10-12 mph depending on the battery power but this thing is incredible.	We ordered this for out six year old granddaughter and she has loved it.	The outer box was beat up and coming apart, but inside the Dune Buggy was intact and undamaged.	After about 6 months the battery quit charging
Conceptually, a good product but poor cushioning.	I've been using it with my patients in physical therapy and they have all enjoyed it and we're surprised by how challenging some of the exercises can be.	We love it, we love that it is hard work, but rewarding.	So my advice to the manufacturer, give a decent guide to your buyers or put something on your website.	It's meant to simply give a good resistance.	The
It looked cool though :)	Not really a big dea, but was a little unexpected.	It was easy to adjust up and down once I got used to it.	Probably just get one from the store so I can check it out	I wouldn’t take a chance on this if it’s going to come right from the factory like this.	Can't wait to use this when I go camping, it's just perfect.	This item was
Description said they run small (one size); but accounting for that deviation did not help.	Overall she's happy to wear them, especially compared to the rental skates.	Love these skates!	The design is great and jackson is always a trusted and known brand with figure skating rinks.	The fit in the foot was good but the laces are too short to lace all the way up.	I ordered them because Jackson has a wider toe
My husband really likes this call.	I'm not a hunter, and certainly no duck or call expert, but I can make it sound well enough like the ducks.	Not a feeder but kills the greeting call.	Get call.	Sturdy little thing sounds like a duck!	Inexpensive enough to not feel bad about losing it in the slough by accident.	Good range, robust sound, and easy to blow.	Received this call when I expected.	It sounds
Fantastic rope.	Either way, it's a well designed rope and worth the money.	Wire cutters are necessary when shortening the rope.	Delivery was super fast and packaged well.	Light weight and comes with a spare!	A tremendous improvement from the old Everlast leather rope that has served me for 20 years.	REALLY INCONVENIENT!!!!!!!	I bought this rope for my daughter who is 5 and just learning to jump rope.	My 10 year old (5 foot)
I received this pump and tried it out.	We are very happy with your product and extremely pleased with your customer service.	This is one of those items you hope you don't need to use while on the trails.	The extension hose makes it easier to access valves in tight spots.	Attaches under water bottle holder.	Appears to be made by high quality materials and definitely performs as described by manufacturer.	I'm afraid it draws
but they are very strong and durable.	It works remarkably well and it is a little heavy compared to my Stradic Ci4, but I don't care if my Battle gets banged up on the rocks I wade in since it's a lot more rugged (and cheaper!).	The reel is second to none.	Awesome reel BUT DONT TRUST THAT COMPANY SELLING THE “used”	Very much worth the price.	Arrived on time (quick!)	I use one for
They are pretty however..:..	Giving as a gift, so that wasn't helpful.	They rollerblade in the house, outside on sidewalks, parks, etc.	Look fairly robust.	Bought these for my 9 year old daughter who wears a size 7.	Was supposed to be a gift for my daughter.	I've been using them for a couple of weeks now.	I tried stretching them out but they made my feet extremely sore.	My 6 year old daughters favorite
Well, we actually received a 35lb silver kettlebell, not the black 30lb.	Very smooth finish no inconsistencies with the handle.	She's happy.........I'm happy.	Love this product!	can't beat the price - quality for the money.	The finish is paint so it may chip if dropped on concrete or other hard surfaces, but overall it is a durable finish.	I also want to comment on the KB grip, particularly the gripping area.	It's a lump of
Not as useful as a rigid paddle.	But, still, really good looking.	I bought DarkFin Webbed Power Swimming Gloves after watching a youtube video on how they were produced and they showed the process which all seems like a big lie to me now.	I am very happy with them.	I feel like superwoman when I slip them on and start swimming !!	I got a size medium and I don't have big hands.	Great
The coffee is the best just like I remembered it years ago before these coffee makers came to light.	(Government-issued coffee just doesn't make it!)	The coffee pot came damaged.	The main issue is the stem as many note, it bends very easily.	The stem is very fragile.	Nice pot - the lid stays on when you pour too - no scalding surprises!	You are only able to make a full pot of coffee.	from
That said.	Has held 0 since sighting it in, eye relief is good not great but good.	The scope is not bad but I could not get it to hold zero .	And as the problem others were having on the off kilter cross hairs.	Stay areound We Need You.	Quite frankly it is a great optic for the price point.	I bought it as a backup of a backup and it primarily sits in
Not impressed	So far these have worked great!!	I returned them because the quality of the balls are not good.	my teenage son uses these for practice.	Amazing how adding colored lacrosse balls to your workouts makes it more fun.	I bought these for my dog who has chewed through multiple “tough” balls.	Scoring with the Money Ball is always more points.	bought for my power chewer, who destroys chuck it balls in 5 minutes.
One hand will fall asleep when using them.	They take a few classes to break in but since then they've been great.	I just need to find better wraps, the fairtex ones get distorted too easily in the washing machine.	I found these gloves to be unnecessarily tough with limited padding that felt like hard plastic on my hands.	The American Flag ones and now these.	The lining in one of my gloves was loose
The bench cushion is very bad with sharp edge.	It's the best decision I've made.	The set is very good.	Not so much fun to put together but not difficult at all.	It can take quite a bit of weight too.	If you buy this make sure you are ready to go to the hardware store.	I don't recommend using the rinky dink joke of an all-in-one tool they give you for assembly.	Assembly was
The elastic belt and spandex material of the bag itself keeps it tight against my body so it doesn't bounce when I'm running.	What a nifty little item!	Now I can wear whatever I want and carry what I need in my spi belt.	The waist belt is by far the best option.	Easy to adjust to your body and doesn't bounce as much as some other running belts do.	It's lightweight and comfortable.	Povket
Now it seems that all of my friends have the same one in different prints.	Whenever people see them, they’re asking where to get theirs.	When it is closed, it has a unique inside color of your choice.	It withstood some great wind and rain.	Also, the button that holds the umbrella open doesn't seem very strong.	The brand name is written in very large letters repeating around the entire umbrella over the edge of
Very versatile.	Only negative aspect is a major one, though: the foam padding wears out too fast.	Square-headed carriage bolts drop into square slots to keep them from spinning when the nut is tightened; that's how it's supposed to work, anyway.	This one, on the other hand, feels sturdy and higher quality.	Not sure how useful this is for the other exercises but it's cool that it can be use in different ways.	Hooked right
Just open the cap of the pump itself.	I was pooped after two balls!	The net bag is great as I keep them in the bag outdoors while not in use.	These balls seem good, although I don’t know how they will hold up long term.	Be warned!	2nd one that we have bought.	The quality and durability are lacking.	We did not go through the effort to send them back.	Its great except it
Wanted puncture resistant shwinn tires.	I can't see a size or performance difference at all.	This is a VERY reliable tire.	When I need tires again, I would look for these same tires.	It some work to install them and center the bead on the the rim.	I live in the Sierra Nevada's with lots of things on the ground that like to flatten tires!	its heavy.	If you want the fastest possible roll, these
A completely frustrating experience.	The bodyfat percentage can also move around a bit.	There have been a couple times where it has misread the first time I've stepped on it, but then the second reading was right on par.	It reliably weighs me about 5-7 lbs heavier than the scale at the doctor's office (even though the atria is used 1st thing in the morning nude).	I weigh morning and night.	I would rate the
The kids & adults had a blast using them for what we called the Bunny Hop race.	One of the only sellers that had same day shipping for this item.	I haven’t noticed the smell since the first day.	It was received broken inside the shrink wrap.	They are potato sacks.	So we created a 50s style children's birthday party, with sack races, volleyball, water ballon toss (which of course became a water ballon fight
These are ok, but not tight enough, I am 6feet 6 inches tall with large calves.	No compression number, and there was a strong chemical odor when I opened the packages.	Like the color assortment.	Guess u her what u paid for.	I could have fit another inch of foot in the actual sock to make it fit somewhat.	I love these socks, they have saved my life!	even though they were the same thing
With the lifetime warranty, what could go wrong?	HMR 17 for squirrel hunting.	Bought another for my 243 cause, cheap, good, and reliable	I did not know what to expect as I had read a couple of complaints that were about this scope although most posts were favorable.	This is my second one.	Got it zerod in at 200 yards and I've loc tightened all the threads on the mount so we'll see how long
Such a great addition to my home gym.	During Covid, I’ve decided to inflate it and give it a good chance.	Very versatile.	Some look a bit tough to do as a beginner but something to work towards.	Still okay but if I'm going to buy a "new" item, a new item is what I want and this must have been a return.	All I received was the ball.	I wanted to add extra air
They ok.	-They feel great, not tight, like someone else posted.	I ordered these for my son - I ordered one size up - because the the rental skates are always the next size from what his wears in a tennis shoe.	i bought them to roll around my work on lunch and they are perfect.	However the bearings are sticky and the wheels are not concrete rink worthy.	Help me feel much more balanced.
Put them on as you're warming up and you will notice a drastic change in knee comfort even outside of your workout.	I sweat and they get sticky due to their neoprene type material.	Wrap-check, brace-check, the neoprene then added a heating element.	No knee pain afterwards.	Love these!	I'm 46 and have never used any type of accessory for lifting.	I recently found out I might have a torn ACL from an injury that
the product is cheap, but the racquet is totally deformed, and there is a big scratch.	They are light weight and really attractive looking.	The grip tape is nice too.	Very light and much easier on the wrist and elbow than previous racquets.	its lightness at the same time will make you a confident player.	I had a Wilson Kforce I was using which was great but I would have to restring often.	It is
Didn't fall off during race starts like the Speedo Jr vanquisher did.	Totally keeps the water out.	If these ever become defective, I will buy again!	She loves the color.	The colors look great.	He used them for swim team all summer.	I like supporting small business from third party sellers.	They last all swim season.	Great goggles!	My 5.5 yo daughter likes it a lot.	They fit my 11-year-old daughter well and seal properly.
bought some for each member of the family.	This hat is awesome!	I have run with it several times and enjoy not having to deal with earbuds.	If you look at the photo provided, you can tell that it is supposed to bunch up a little and flop over, but on a real head it does way more than shown.	He's outside a decent amount so its really convenient to have.	The sound quality is
He loves having it at home as he can knock out some pull ups anytime he walks by it.	Looks like I had the same problem as the most recent review.	It is a much better alternative to the doorway mount bar.	If I had one suggestion it would be for the bar to be just a couple inches wider for really wide grip pull ups, but I wouldn't say this is a major fault.
