Install is easy and other than changing input on tv it works just like a roku tv set. My old flat TV works as a smart TV with Roku. Have then Roku 3 on our big tv, bought this for smaller bedroom TV. Love roku very easy to install very fast connecting to Netflix and Amazon prime! I love my roku - so easy to set up and so easy to use. It turns your TV into a Roku TV!! This is our Second Roku device as we needed it on another TV. Roku is fantastic works like a smart TV, if you don’t have a smart TV.
We love the picture of this tv! Great tv the picture is amazing. The picture on this tv is amazing! This is the best of the best If you ask me Love the tv The picture is so bright and perfect Feels like your in the tv So clear Total upgrade from a 48” tv to this awesome picture and great value for a tv this size!! Excellent TV with amazing picture and quality. easy of use is and picture quality are by far the best feature of this tv. Amazing picture quality and Smart TV options and great price.
I LOVE the Bose noise cancelling headphones. I purchased these after I lost my over the ear Bose noise cancelling headphones. Noise cancellation is better than over the ear headphones. The noise cancelling is impressive, but not as good as over the ear bose headphones. Hands down the best noise cancelling device I have ever used, even better than the Bose over the ear headphones. You may be able to buy noise cancelling headphones with the price of this, but it’s well worth it. Bose quality of sound, good noise cancelling feature. Sound is great and as expected from a Bose but the noise cancelling wasn't what I was looking for.
I wanted the best Intel gaming processor available without going to the new i9 which still runs around $1000. The processor runs great, I'm not using the stock cooler so no problem with the temps. Best cpu I have had in my 20 years of gaming. I will have this CPU running for many hours at 100% load and there are no issues using the stock CPU cooler. Fastest chip on the market for gaming (for less than 1k USD) Intel uses cheap thermal paste between the CPU die and heatsink which makes this CPU to run hot. Great CPU, just make sure you have a top level cooler as it does run hot. Excellent cpu for gaming. Great CPU for Gaming ... Easy to overclock if you know what you are doing
Love this camera! LOVE this camera! Love everything about this camera. Love this camera! I love this camera! Love this camera. Great camera. Camera as described.
Bought the monitor for work travel so I wouldn't have to work off my laptop display all day. I do not carry this monitor with me I just use it at home as a 2nd screen for work. Great monitor, much better picture than my laptop. Great price and good resolution for using it as a second monitor on the laptop. A very nice second monitor for laptop! Decent screen size for a 2nd monitor. Really great for those who travel but need a second monitor to work. While it may be a great travel monitor, it did not work for me.
the tv is great great picture great sound nice tv Great picture and even the sound is good for a tv. The TV itself is really great as far as sound and picture goes. Good picture, would definitely recommend this tv. Picture is good and it's a good overall TV. Amazing tv does everything you want and has great picture. Great TV with excellent picture. Meanwhile I have a samsung tv that we’ve had for 10 years which has better picture quality than this tv ever did and is STILL going strong without any issues.
Looks great and the touch screen is very responsive I love the Apple CarPlay I just think it’s just an overall good radio upgrade for your car at a great price. My hubby liked the radio and the Apple carplay so much that I ended up ordering a second pioneer radio for his car. I love the Apple car play the unit sounds awesome! Overall, this new radio made me feel like my car is brand new again, I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to get an aftermarket radio with Carplay. I installed this radio in my car. Great radio with apple car play! No apple car play on this unit. This radio is amazing for the price point and to have Apple CarPlay.
As if spending $150 on this device wasn't enough, Slingbox charges a lot of money for their apps, and has now placed ads in their desktop player for Windows and OSX. Now they are running video ads that you must wait through before getting to your Slingbox connection. this product worked great until the greedy bastards at slingbox decided to put ads on their desktop player (the only way to connect). So now you can watch TV ads and Slingbox Ads! UPDATE: Slingbox just pushed an update to the desktop player, and now the ads are even more intrusive. Not sure why Slingbox thinks it's fair to ask their customers to pay $150 for the privilege to look at their ads. It was easy to set up, and I have it running through my Roku-2, so I do not need to connect my PC or tablet to the TV to watch through Slingbox. You will need to upgrade your sling player to the newest version and the slingbox solos that I have wont work on the same player as the M1 uses.
I Love this lens take great photos I can't believe the price is so low for such a great lens. I was looking for an inexpensive Canon lens to give me a nice bokeh effect for my photos and this lens was perfect for that. I am just beginning in photography but will say this about this lens, its a great buy for the money and a great lens for a beginner wanting to do some portraits like I am. This lens takes great low light pictures. Great lens and takes great pictures. This is only my 2nd "REAL" lens (lens purchased outside of the kit lenses) and I can't say that I love this lens as much as I do my 85mm 1.8, but its performance is SO much better than my kit lenses and, for the price.... This my first 50mm lens from Canon and I love it. I think for photos this is an amazing lens!
These Headphones are super comfortable and the Sound quality is really good. Good quality headphones, sound is excellent and the battery life is good. These are comfortable headphones that look and sound great. My own headphones cost £90 and they are better sound quality, have noise cancellation and better sound quality. Quality headphones at a good price. That being said the overall sound quality is quite good. The sound is good. Very good sound.
Yes good battery and lightweight but just better off getting a real laptop not a chromebook. The Acer chromebook is the only computer I would use for my internet work. If you are thinking of getting a Google Chromebook this is the laptop to purchase. This is a great laptop Chromebook. The laptop works great, turns on quickly, and feels well built however the problem for me is that its a Chromebook. I love love love my new Acer Swift and the Chromebook, while a great machine for the money, didn't have enough 'stuff' for me to keep. After using this Chromebook for the last month I have to say it's the BEST laptop I have ever had. This Chromebook is my daily laptop.
The Arlo Q plus is a excellent camera with 1080p picture, What I like it about it's easy to setup and the installation process is easy, I really love the crisp and sharp picture and video, it's has excellent night vision and the camera quality is great! This seems like a great camera and I love all my other arlo cameras. Arlo q plus is a nice good quality camera and very easy to set up. Super easy to setup and the Arlo app is great for working with the cameras viewing, etc. I install security cameras as part of my small business and I would say that the Arlo camera system is probably the best out there in terms of picture and sound quality. If you want a camera that can connect to Arlo you need to buy the normal camera + long cable + base. I already own the Arlo Pro wireless camera system and added this camera to my system. Having both cameras (wired and wireless) I can definitely say that Arlo Q serious is a better camera all around.
The picture quality on this TV is amazing. This TV has excellent picture quality. We love the color and picture of our new Sony tv. The best feature for this TV, of course, is the picture quality. Excellent picture quality and a nice looking TV. Loves the picture on this TV. The most beautiful TV picture I've ever seen. Nice looking tv with solid picture quality.
Love this camera... Great pictures and very easy to use Love this camera. Love this camera. I love this camera, I love this camera, I love this camera! I love this camera. I love this camera. I love this camera and all it can do. It's my first camera and I love it.
I love this Bose Speaker, the bass sounds so good!! Love the sound quality of this speaker. Sound is great for such a small portable speaker, Bose does it again with a quality speaker. Amazing sound from this Bose speaker. I love the sound that comes from this speaker. I really love the sound of this speaker. I love Bose, this is my third speaker purchase. I love my Bose speaker!
These headphones sound great. The headphones sound is amazing. Bluetooth Headphones and best sound quality at this price Best wireless headphones I have ever used by far, Comfortable with amazing sound. The sound seems excellent, but the headphones are just not that comfortable over my ears. I love everything about these headphones. The sound quality in these headphones is outstanding. These are excellent headphones.
I needed expansion ports for my USB 3.0 and order the Anker USB 3.0 4-Port Portable Aluminum Hub. I was only able to fit 3 USB drives in my old 5 port USB hub because the ports were too close together. Great little 4 port usb 3.0 hub, wish the cord was a little longer but you can easy extend it with a USB 3.0 extension cable. I plug this USB hub into my PS3 and it works perfectly...enough said. Ive placed this hub on my desk to have access to my usb 3.0 ports in the back of my computer. This little USB hub works great. I needed a new USB hub and Anker hasn't let me down before. A+ quality USB hub like everything from Anker.
I like the storage space and that it's easy to move games from your internal drive(the drive on your xbox console)and that you can delete games off it just as easy. I was able to load all my XBOX ONE S games on this drive and all have been working with no issues. Worked perfectly with my Xbox One S. Now I can store all my games on my external hard drive. The Seagate Xbox One Gaming Drive loads games quickly and I have storage for days. I have more room on my Xbox hard drive to play more games and more games I have over 30 games downloaded on the xbox and external hard drive. Super small, easy to set up, and so far there has been no noticeable difference between games loaded on this drive and on our Xbox One drive. Something cool about hard drives is that you if you ever switch to another Xbox you don’t have to download the games you have on your hard drive to the other Xbox, you only have to plug it in and start playing your games.
Camera seems to take good pictures (at least the best I can tell by looking at the screen on the camera). Good little camera, great pictures. I was looking for a camera to take better quality pictures than my phone. Nice camera, great pictures. Camera is good. Good camera! Was probably a good camera in 2013. Seems like a good camera.
Love this camera and easy to use. Easy to use, great quality camera. Love the camera. I love this camera! What can I say, but that I really LOVE this camera! I love the camera!! I love this camera! I LOVE this camera.
I bought the clear stand to hold my headphones and it does a good job and it looks sleek and nice on my desk. The stand is nice when the headphones are on it for sure. Its too light so when I take my headphones off the stand... This stand provides a convenient place to put your headset / headphones when you're not using them. I really like how easy it is to put the headphones on the stand. it's a clear plastic stand for headphones. It is exactly what it advertised: a simple, sleek, and sturdy headset stand. Holds your headphones well but requires two hands when you remove headphones as the stand will fall over.
Good wireless router. Got a great price on this wireless router. This is a great wireless router. Works fine as a wireless router. I would still recommend this router to anyone that doesn't already have a wireless router...but if you are looking for better wireless coverage, you might be disappointed. This wireless router is really Fast! We've been really happy with our wireless router. This router was easy to set up.
This motherboard is a great board, but ASUS is not being transparent on if the bios is or is not going to support Ryzen 3000. Newest BIOS version is 4024 for ASUS B350 board, but 4011 works just fine. ASUS is kind of slow on updating their motherboard bios. big mistake after 2 bios updates everything was smooth after latest bios update board wont this is 2017post,cannot get into bios to reset cannot use usb flash to rollback or update again This board was rushed out,there isnt even a reset switch on the board,they actually want you to use a screwdriver and short the pins. I do wish there was a setting in the BIOS to turn off the on board lights, when the system is off, or even entirely, but overall it is a great product. Pros- Great looking motherboard (Red Leds Gpu/Lower Left of board) Great price Overclocking abilities Cons- motherboard still won't let me overclock my memory to its OC 3200mhz. For a new board Asus has already released TWO bios updates that I have flashed to my bios, DOES NOTHING to correct any issues. Good budget motherboard after bios upgrade.
Scanner is fast to set up and fast scanning! The Epson scanner is very easy to use and scans quickly. When I try to use the Epson Scan app it tells me the scanner is in use. Open the app epson smart scan, it will look for the scanner by IP. I have many years of paper files to scan and this scanner is making it much easier. I had a scanner prior which took several steps to scan and download documents. This scanner is fast and easy to use. This scanner is extreamly easy to use and works perfectly for scanning documents!
The problem I had with this keyboard is the bad placement of the keys to the left of the keyboard. This is the 2nd time I have bought this keyboard. most comfortable keyboard that I've had. I have had this keyboard for about 5 months. The keyboard works great. Keyboard works great. I love this keyboard. I love this keyboard!
It is a nice case that fits the need for the switch. This case fits everything I could ever need for the switch. I even have a comfort grip case on my switch and it still fits in this case. My son loves this case, it fits everything you could every need for a switch and it is durable too. If you are looking for a case to hold your switch, dock, games, controllers, and any other accessories (I have a grip case as well for when I play the switch in portable mode) then this is exactly what you are looking for. This switch case is great! This is a great case for a Switch! Very sturdy great case to put your Switch in.
However, if you're purchasing the 1600x make sure you have an AM4 compatible CPU cooler as there isn't one supplied with this processor. My last CPU was an Intel, but ever since AMD came out with the Ryzen line of CPUs, I wanted one. awesome CPU for overall use, purchased this for my new build focused on gaming/streaming, which is why i chose AMD, for the more cores and threads, for the price (strict budget) CPU is great for tasks such as streaming/video encoding, slight impact on gaming due to AMD and not Intel, but still is pretty good! A good Ryzen 5 CPU at a good price. I purchased this CPU for my 2nd Gaming PC build and I love it! This didn't come with a cooler which i knew before purchase, only the CPU some paperwork and ryzen 5 sticker. Coming from an Intel 2500k overclocked to 4.2 to this cpu at stock was a nice upgrade. It's a great gaming CPU for the price.
I have just purchased this product as I was looking for a compact and clear set of binoculars for bird watching. I was able to see tiny birds clearly, and the compact size and light weight of these binoculars is perfect. Great price for high quality binoculars and nice and compact. Very clear vision with or with out glasses I would recommend for any body looking for small and light weight binoculars Easy to focus,clear images, nice pair of binoculars Love that it's so lightweight for easy packing and traveling, great clarity, best compact binoculars I've ever had. These binoculars are nice and compact, making them lightweight and portable, but they still have a solid zoom good picture quality. I would recommend these binoculars to anyone looking for a light-weight, easy to carry and easy to focus pair.
While the maps were more up to date than the rental car gps, the traffic system is awful. I used the TomTom GO 620 6-Inch GPS Navigation for 3 months and now it has a blue screen. After four straight days of trying multiple different TomTom websites I was unable to get any response despite numerous attempts to reset a new password, download software updates, find out how to download European maps. Garmin wants to charge you for all out of country ( usa ) maps, TomTom gives them for free. The best GPS by TomTom I’ve had and this must by my 4th one? I have always liked the TomTom GPS. I've had multiple TomTom GPS in past and loved them. Description says - “Lifetime Maps (World) Download and update maps from around the world at no extra cost for the life of your TomTom GO”.
I recommend this product.This also gives indoor temperature.This light meter covers the basics well, and I used it for LED lighting work. Useful and accurate, this light meter has been useful for measuring Lux as I get into growing my own vegetables and being self sustaining! The meter is probably okay for approximate light level testing when directly under a light source in an office environment. This is an excellent light meter. I use this meter in my office.Great value for the money and reliable,fast & easy to use. The meter is well designed, easy to use, and seems accurate, at least enough for my use. needed a basic meter to set up lighting for living area, this a good tool. Good customer service and the light meter is okay.
Over all a good camera. This is a very good camera. I am not a camera professional but I can tell you this camera takes amazing pictures. camera is very good but just only camera. So far it seems to be a great little camera. Great camera. Great camera. A GREAT LITTLE CAMERA!
I found the radio difficult to program manually and then later was made aware of programming the radio though a cable using the CHIRP software. Find it to be a very good radio, easy to program it, good sound, using it as a scanner.I recommend this radio. I like the radio but I have to spend more time with it to program it.If you have some time it is a good radio to have. Very good quality radio and the a great price too. Love the radio..not easy to program from the radio keypad..using chirp to program makes it a breeze..good sound quality and have been receiving good reports back .would buy again.. Great little radio if one can get pass learning how to program and using the radio. This is not an easy radio to program. I am also considering purchasing the radio repeater interface box and another pair of radios so our teams can extend our radio coverage in the more remote areas of our county So far I am very pleased with this radio.
Unfortunately, this particular drive [ Seagate Expansion 2TB Portable External Hard Drive USB 3.0 (STEA2000400) ] was a great disappointment. Besides installing the drive, they also helped me install their software needed to make a mirror copy of my computer hard drive on the Seagate external drive . Now I have to return this one, getting a replacement drive from Seagate for my other drive, and I also bought a WD drive just in case these continue to fail. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a hard drive that works for only a few months. This drive having USB 3.0 which is needed for the Xbox, makes this drive seem almost faster loading and installing games than the internal hard drive. The Seagate Expansion 2TB Portable External Hard Drive gives me well over 4,400 times the storage capacity of that old computer with a second hard drive (10,000 times the computer's original installed internal memory). I had been running out of hard drive space, and knew that I could add an external drive to save games to. This hard drive was purchased to replace the last Seagate Expansion hard drive that failed.
The sound is not as good as over the ear headphones but for the size they are good. I have one the ear headphones but I feel the sound is about the same. I’ve always liked in ear headphones or earbuds. They have amazing sound, better than any headphones/ear buds I have ever used before. I like that the headphones stay in your ear. I have owned the original wireless Beats ear buds, Bose wireless earbuds, and the Airpods Pro and these Powerbeats are amazing and by far the best. These are not on ear headphones. The sound quality is great, like all Beats headphones.
I just love this camera. Love this camera. Love this camera. I love this camera. Great camera all around. Great Camera! Great camera! Great camera.
Other than that it is a good tv with great picture for the price. Best picture I have ever had in a TV. A very, very good TV for a great price. Great TV for picture quality, price and free tv channel but too many issues. Great TV, easy to use. The picture on this tv is amazing! Great tv, especially for the price. It’s a great TV for the price.
Great camera and very easy to use. Great camera for the price. Great camera for the price. Overall a great camera at a good price. Great camera at a good price. Love this camera. Love this camera. Love the camera.
Speed increased by 100MB once I upgraded to this router from another Asus router. After years of using Netgear products I bought this Asus router to replace a Netgear router that I had been waiting for over a year for a firmware update. This was my first ASUS router. This is my second asus router. Do not buy this or any router from ASUS. This will be the last ASUS router I ever buy. Great WiFi Router! Great WIFI Router!
I love this bag; however, it does not fit a 17.3 laptop. I had been looking all over for a nice laptop bag for my 17". A laptop in this bag will not have room for much else. Love the bag well worth the price, take it with me every where I go, school day out at library, just a good bag to have holds my stuff and looks good to I needed a bag for my 17.3" laptop and this one fits and looks great. So if you have a lot of things you want to carry along with your laptop, might not be the bag for you. The bag works well for me, looks good, actually comfortable, and the quality is nice. Bag is very nice and is of great quality.
These little speakers sound great and the price was right. These speakers sound very good for the price. The speakers are of good quality and sound great. Good looking 2-way speakers with great sound quality. Great speakers, good all around sound. Great speakers with good sound. Great sound good looking speakers. These speakers sound great and look great.
Very fast, very nice looking laptop. Nice laptop, fast, quiet and a great laptop to use! I've owned this HP laptop for almost four months (my first laptop) and no problems at all. The laptop was easy to set up and works fine. Good laptop for price. A good laptop for the price! Laptop fan noise is unbearable.brand new laptop with no app makes more sound than a fan.Returned the laptop within one day.Waste of time procuring it.Save your money. This laptop would have likely been perfect, if the WiFi worked.
But when the outlet is off for too long the whole power strip disconnects from both the Google Home app and the Smart Link app. Alexa Smart Home will find the power strip and all the plugs and ports after Smart Life setup. And has a smart app that you can power on and off while your not home. work as expected with the smart life app and alexa. It works with Smart Life app that I can connect to Google home. Awesome product and was really easy to set up everything works right through my Alexa app. Using Alexa app, search for smart devices. This is a great product but the app is a totally copy of Smart Things, which is a well known free app that let’s you control not just this product but most others as well.
Maybe it's a good TV but not a good monitor. It would be even better if it was just a monitor and not a TV. I bought this as a monitor, not as a TV. Great price for a fantastic TV / Monitor 39" . EXCELLENT AS A COMPUTER MONITOR AS WELL AS A TV. great value and probably a good TV, but was hoping to use as a monitor. This TV/Monitor is awesome with the new video card. It may be okay as a computer monitor, but as a TV it's horrible.
I got my Acer TC-885 and have it all set up I got it to replace my old unit that was windows 7 this new computer is very fast and was very easy to set up it took about an hour to transfer my files from the old computer and about an hour to fully set up I use it for day to day home use bills and shopping on line it's great i'm very happy with it and if anyone is looking for a fast home set up this is it and it's a very good buy for the money. For price you get a good computer Great and fast computer, I really like it, first time buying Acer and I Am sold. This would NOT be a good gaming computer. Like any new computer, this machine works fine. Super value Windows 10 home computer. So far great computer for the price. Buy this computer!!
I just got this printer and it was so easy to set up print! This printer is easy to set up, works great, fast and excellent printing quality. But this printer was cheaper to purchase than the replacement ink and print head my printer said it needed. Printer was easy to install and the print quality is good. This printer works good until you have to replace the ink, then it will not print properly. Great printer, very easy to set up, had to connect on line as the disk that came with the printer did not let me print. This printer works great with WIFI and Air Print. It is our first wireless printer and it was easy to set up, and works really well.
Works great for that old laptop which doesn't have a DVD drive. I bought this external drive because my new laptop didn't have a DVD / CD drive. Works great, love this option as new laptop did not come with DVD/CD drive worked as expected, great for on the go or when you have a new laptop that doesnt have a cd/dvd drive This LG DVD drive works fine. If you need a DVD drive at a great price this is the one to get. I bought this drive for my laptop that does not have a DVD drive. So this external usb drive works good.
I purchased the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 WiFi Cable Modem Router (C7000v2) as a replacement for the Comcast/Xfinity modem/router I was paying $15 a month to use for internet and wifi. The netgear c7000 cable modem/wifi router was fast and easy to install. Netgear is is a great WiFi cable modem router. Great WiFi Cable Modem Router! After an easy install this Netgear modem/router is doing great. With this Netgear Modem/Router it was easy to set up. The Netgear 2-in-1 router and modem is easy to install. The Netgear modem/router is worth the $200 because you use your internet everyday.
Great Product overall I love this speaker great sound awesome bass Sound quality is awesome for a speaker this size. The bass and sound in general is better than any other <$100 bluetooth speaker I've had. This speaker is compact with great sound. Overall a good speaker for the price. This speaker has been great in the time I've had it. This speaker is so good. Great speaker!!
Pros: features, build quality, size, price, any subwoofer drastically improves a stereo system Cons: compared to my cheaper Polk PSW10, this is terrible. I needed a small subwoofer for a living room installation. After my update to my 5.1 surround sound system to a 7.1 surround sound system with a new Onkyo AV receiver and two Polk satellite speakers I decided on replacing my ancient Polk PSW100 powered subwoofer with a Polk PSW111 Compact Powered 8" Subwoofer with a Mediabridge double shielded 8 ft RCA to RCA cable. Polk is a quality a/v company, so I expected a lot from my new powered subwoofer. I've always loved Polk Audio, and this PSW111 powered subwoofer shows why. I purchased this subwoofer for my bedroom and i had limited space, the subwoofer seems alittle small but i can deal with it.I wii be making some more room soon and i will upgrade to alarger polk sub in the near months to come mean while i will deal with it. Skeptical at first, but took a chance and went with this subwoofer to go with 4 mc60s and a polk center channel speaker. I received this subwoofer as a "freebie" with the purchase of 2 TSi400 Polk Audio floor standing speakers on my Pioneer VSX-1021.
Always wanted a nice set of pots and pans and this set is the one. This set of pots & pans has turned out to be the best set I've ever purchased. Great price for this quality set of pots/pans! But for what I want, a great set of pots and pans which heat evenly and quickly, these are GREAT. This is my first set of pots and pans that are higher quality than the cheap non stick set everyone gets when they move into their first place. My first set of really great pans. Wonderful...I love my new set, is everything and more of what I expected....If anyone needs a new set of pans, look at these pans. Quality set of pots and pans.
But the vacuum works well and the battery power is good. The vacuum works well when it is working but battery doesn't last very long. This happened the last time I bought this vacuum, and since the battery cost almost as much as a new vacuum, I just bought a new one. I have another vacuum just like this one, so I used the battery for it to get the new one to work. Tried our old battery in the new vacuum and it worked perfect. Even if there were no battery issues I still wouldn't buy this vacuum again. But the big problem is that the battery doesn't last as long as the vacuum. I think I can vacuum about 400 sq ft of tile and area rugs before needing to recharge, so get the extra battery if you vacuum a really large area and/or vacuum often, just so you don't have to wait for the single battery to recharge.
We have used both sides of the plates to grill/griddle and everything cooks evenly, in much less time than a regular grill. The grill plates heat up quickly, and are easy to remove and clean. This product is every bit as good as the positive reviews promised: easy to clean, easy to switch out griddle/grill/waffle plates, easy to store. I ordered the waffle plates to go with this and love this cuisinart grill. The grill is easy to clean, the plates snap in and out easily for cleaning and do well in the dishwasher. Waffle plates are a separate purchase, and the grill plates it comes with have both grill and smooth surfaces, allowing use as a contact grill or an open griddle. I bought it mainly for the waffle plates, but find that I use the grill and griddle more than I ever thought I would. Easily clean the grill/griddle plates in warm soapy water or dishwasher.
We love grilled cheese sandwiches and the panini press makes them so much better. I love this panini press and use it several times per week to make grilled cheese and other sandwiches. My kids love it most of all and have made lots of sandwiches using the panini press. Fantastic panini grill, makes great sandwiches get hot quickly well made product, nice design I won’t buy one again and as I said in the beginning, unless you really like panini or hot sandwiches, just get a food grill. This is a great little machine that heats quickly and makes good panini sandwiches. It heats up quickly and makes delicious Panini sandwiches. With this Hamilton Beach Panini Press, my sandwiches tasted much better plus it is easier to clean.
It’s still stuck on the bathroom wall and the kids love it since we don’t have much surface area to put a toothbrush and cups. Completely eliminated bathroom counter clutter and kids like having their own cups and racks for their toothbrushes. This is a great addition to a bathroom with no counter space, very happy with it , my electric toothbrushes wouldn't fit in the holders but it fit in the top basket My husband loves it because now their toothbrushes aren't all over the bathroom counter. Toothbrush holds very well in place and the kids love using their cups!! There are plenty of room for more toothbrushes and the kids love the colors It stays up very well on the wall even though my kids are fairly rough when grabbing their toothbrushes. It really stick to the wall and hold the 8 toothbrushes on my house.
Great microwave, has some great features like the grill function. Great price for large microwave the grill feature is subpar. All 3 works: microwave, convection and grill. The grill feature is amazing no more microwave taste. I Love my new microwave oven. I use the Grill feature more than the microwave. I haven't used it as an oven as of yet but the microwave is very powerful and quiet. its a nice microwave and the convection oven heats quickly.
I was very excited about these copper pans. What a great price on a great product - give your coated pots and pans to Goodwill and discover what quality copper ware can do for your cooking! Within two uses my pans looked yellow instead of copper. Even after learning to cook with them, they are still hard to clean and the copper has to be polished after every use... With 4 children and a busy life, there is no time to polish pots and pans... He told us that this set has all the conduction of good copper pans and the ease of cleaning that the stainless steel or aluminum (not sure which) provides on the cooking surface. Most beautiful pots and pans I have EVER owned. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these pots and pans!!! Everything stuck to them turned black inside pans and copper discolored badly after each use not worth the clean up and maintenance
While this little fridge/freezer is a very nice size with a great capacity only the refrigerator works. Very quiet works great for an every day fridge freezer Works great and has a lot of space in both the fridge and freezer. its the perfect size and I love the freezer fridge combination though, and it looks perfect in the space. We needed a mini fridge with a separate freezer compartment with its own door. Wish it had more fridge capacity and the freezer were a little smaller but it cools perfectly and is relatively quiet. I like that the freezer door is separate from the fridge and has dirt storage. Fridge works good, freezer doesn't.
You wouldn't even know that I had the mattress cover on her bed if I didn't tell you! I was looking for a waterproof mattress cover to use with my new mattress. Does not make the mattress too hot and you can’t even tell it’s on the bed! The Waterproof Mattress Protector fits a thick mattress very well. I purchased this product for my new mattress. So far this mattress protector has been very comfortable and easy to fit on our mattress. Great Mattress Protector....Fits well around the mattress. Since we bought a new mattress we wanted a new mattress cover.
Really nice bookcase, sturdy and nice looking solid wood shelves. Finish is good for the price and love the wood shelves and industrial look. High end looking wood shelves and VERY easy to put together! Very nice desk, sturdy, easy to put together, and looks great. This shelf is really good quality, easy to put together, and sturdy. the shelves are beautiful and were easy to put together....love them.. This was super easy to put together (think it took about ten minutes total) and I was surprised by how beautiful the wood shelves are. It looks great, and it's easy to put together and sturdy.
This mattress is very comfortable when sleeping alone. The mattress is comfortable. So I received a defective mattress after 2 weeks of sending pictures back and forth with the Casper “ specialist” I’m still awaiting my new Mattress to arrive in the coming weeks that being said I’ve I’ve been sleeping in the defective mattress this whole time and I have to admit even though it’s defective I’m getting better sleep than with my old mattress I’m looking forward to sleep on the non defective mattress and I will post a review on that later Definitely the most comfortable mattress I've ever used (over a year now). Had a sleep number mattress before I got the Casper mattress and wow what a difference. We have been using our Casper king size mattress for four months and it is the most comfortable mattress I have ever laid on. By far the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on. Have had this mattress for four months now and we love it.
Absolutely love this deep fryer because of the easy to clean drain oil feature! Absolutely love this deep fryer, it heats up fast, cooks great and the storage for the oil works great. The ability to drain and filter the oil for the next use so you have clean oil is probably the best feature but this fryer also has quick recovery when frying. I have this fryer for a couple of years now and and it so easy to clean and the oil self storage to great. It is so great to be able to automatically drain the oil after use; this allows me to clean the deep fryer each time we use it. Great fryer easy to clean/drain oil, cooks great does as good a job as professional cookers. The oil filtration system works well and the fryer is very easy to clean. I love the way I can filter out all the debris from the used oil and store it so I can clean my fryer and put away.
Heats up fast and does a good job with panini sandwiches. This Breville Panini Duo machine makes yummy sandwiches and it is the best panini maker I've found on the market. Excellent panini press...makes great sandwiches and easy to use. We've had panini or grilled sandwiches 3 days in a row. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys panini sandwiches. Got this as a B-day gift for wife because she likes Panini sandwiches - now I'm the "hero" of the house. This unit is good though - makes a great panini and we use it a lot... it's just not as easy to take the food off the grill or to clean. It cooks everything from the expected Panini sandwiches to fried parmesan zucchini slices.
The mattress doesn’t fit on the frame quite right, but the bed seems sturdy. I was looking for a bed frame that didn't need a box spring for a mattress but was still sturdy. Very excellent product design, so easy to put together and very sturdy, so far very happy with this bed frame. This bed frame is sturdy and fairly easy to assemble. This item was perfect since I could use my same bed frame and had a sturdy support for my box spring and mattress. This bed frame was very easy to put together and perfect for my queen mattress! The bed frame is easy to put together. This bed frame is very sturdy.
Easy to use and make the best coffee. If you like a good cup of coffee, you will LOVE this Coffee Maker!!! It’s everything I want in a coffee maker - nice, hot coffee and a carafe that won’t break. This coffee maker makes a great cup of coffee. Makes a great cup of coffee but the carafe only holds 4 cups of coffee. The coffee taste as good or better than coffee house coffee. If you love coffee, this is a must own. I love coffee!
My sewing area is small and I was tired of the big ironing board and full size steam iron taking up so much space, when I mostly need to iron small pieces. This iron the perfect size for sewing but i never got the steam to work. This is great for someone who’s sewing I don’t love the steamer part the iron is fine very small so its great for traveling but so small it takes longer to iron obviously. It is heavy for a small steam iron, which is a good! I love the size of this little steam iron. I love this little iron, it fits so nice in your hand and gets really hot and does have steam. If you are looking for a small iron that is easy to travel with and don’t care that it doesn’t steam, this one would work. I've been doing a lot of sewing lately (masks) and wanted a smaller iron that heats quickly and doesn't take up a lot of space...this little but mighty steam iron does that and it meets all my needs.
I love this crock pot.Its the best crock pot i ever had.I love its so easy to use and when you set the timer it automatically sets the temperature on the setting it needs to be on,It also automatically goes to warm after the cooking time is up.It also has a seal around the lid for when you cook so that the fluids dont leak out.I also love how its easy to carry and it has a locking lid for when you need to carry it or travel with it the locking lid proves the extra protection for your food when you are transporting it.Its easy to clean and easy to use.The best crock pot ever However, with this crock pot I really only need about 4 hours...and that's with the food cooking on the low setting. This crock does a great job the timer is spot on.. no over cooking and it keeps food warm when food is done! After many years our old crock pot no longer switched to warm after cooking on high all day so after much research we chose this crockpot I have used it 10 times already and other then it loosing programming after a power flicker love it, why did they not add program save feature like even the cheaper timers have Everything I love about a crockpot plus the timer makes it even better by switching to warm after the time you set it to cook for that way food doesn't dry out. A crock pot with a lid that seals AND has a "warm" setting. Great crock pot, love the locking lid feature. I received my first Crock Pot as a Christmas gift in the 70's, and fell in love with slow cooking.
This microwave is easy to keep clean, easy to quickly use, and heats evenly. This is a very simple microwave that would be great for someone that cannot understand the buttons on most microwaves. easy to operate/program, powerful microwave oven and easy to keep clean as well. This solid, durable commercial microwave is very easy to use and extremely easy to clean. nice size, well built purchased because unlike home microwaves, this commercial microwave does not have a that annoying turntable. When the old donated microwave at the office died, I jumped at the opportunity to replace it with this commercial microwave. It works very well, heats remarkably evenly for a microwave. I really love this microwave, but it stopped heating in the 14th month - - only six weeks after the warranty ran out!
This is the best vacuum I have had for picking up pet hair on hardwood floors.I have had this vacuum for 3 months and have had no problems,I was thinking about buying another one just to have an extra one when this gets old.The price was great for how good it works! This is such a great vacuum for pet hair on hardwood floors/tile (I don't have carpet)! Picks up dog hair on hardwood better than any other vacuum I have used. After a month of having it I gave up on it and got a brand new vacuum that works great on my hardwood floors and does a much better job of getting up dog/cat hair and dirt. If you need a vacuum for hard floors for small debris of pet hair this is it. This little vacuum gets all the dirt and hair. Now almost 6 months later its nothing but a hair vacuum. There's really no such thing as a "pet hair" vacuum.
the cherry pitter works really well and is so much more efficient than the paring knife I was using to cut the pit out of cherries for my kids There is no need to line up the cherry perfectly and hold the pitter a certain way and for the first time, I didn't wear an apron to pit cherries...the splatter shield really works. I had an old cherry pitter that was hard to use and often did not do the job - but this one is GREAT - just get one if you need to pit cherries - very fast, reliable, and easy to use. The cherry pitter is easy to use and make pitting cherries and olives so easy.. Cherry pitter works well and pits 9 out 10 cherries without any problems. This product from OXO takes a difficult job and makes it so easy to pit cherries, that we can now enjoy fresh cherry pies throughout the season. Great gadget..comes in very handy for kids especially..my 3 year old would'nt let me cut the cherries into half for me to be able to pit them but with this cherry pitter I can maintain the shape and look of the cherry and pit the seed easily for her! I first saw this cherry and olive pitter when I visited my daughter and she was removing pits from cherries for my 2 1/2 year old grandson.
These are good for putting extra storage under your bed, but not all the legs on my bed frame fit into these risers. By mistake, I ordered the three inch bed risers which did not raise my bed up as high as I wanted. We thought if it was sturdy enough for a bed, it would work for a chair. Very sturdy and a perfect height to raise the head of the bed. They don't make the bed too high but just enough lift for some extra under bed storage. Great Bed Risers...well made...works well 3" additional height .... additional storage ..my dog now fits under the bed....Thanks.. These allow me to have more storage under my bed. We use these to raise a bed and can fit under bed storage totes.
This machine lets me brew a cup of coffee at a time, but also lets me use whatever coffee I have. Using the same coffee that I was using in the Keurig, I get a MUCH better cup of coffee. It is easy to make a great cup of coffee. My coffee goes a long way because it doesn't take much coffee to make one cup. This coffee maker does not brew hot enough to make a great cup of coffee. love this coffee machine, easy ,quick, and makes great coffee. Easy to clean and do a second coffee too. great if you want just one cup of coffee!
I love this rice cooker, its easy to use and easy to clean! The great thing about this rice cooker for us is that we can steam their veggies and cook the rice at the same time. This rice cooker is awesome - I haven't cooked anything else in it, but cooks regular rice perfectly, and very easy to clean! Great rice cooker, easy to use and clean. I LOVE this Rice Cooker, so easy to just set it and go. great product great price loved the best rice cooker ever Easy to clean look nice and the water doesn't come out from rice cooker make the kitchen table clean. Very large rice cooker for a good price and easy to use..
I tried to store the broom inside the dustpan but it broke a few bristles but you can still hook it to it but not put it inside the dust pan. The little teeth on the dustpan work great for getting all the dust and dog hair out of the broom bristles. The broom works great and I love that I can sweep crumbs into the dustpan without having to bend down. the broom is a bit small but the dustpan work great and the broom cleaning part of the dust pan works amazing and its lasted the test of time had it for months and still using it so i high recommend the comb on the dustpan removes the dust from broom, and it is is strong enough that i know it won't break when i sweep daily after my five cats. Love this broom and dust pan set!!! Love this broom/dust pan set. The broom is just fine and the dustpan will pick up the dust without it going underneath.
I am pleased with the mattress pad, it washed nicely and fit easily on my queen mattress. great mattress pad fits well on my bed well made and great price The mattress pad is very well made, soft and fit the mattress perfectly. Once in the bed, it made my mattress more comfortable than ever. The mattress pad was the perfect size to fit over both the mattress and foam bed topper and the combination made our bed so much more comfortable. Mattress pad was a very nice quality and fit the mattress well. I was looking for a mattress pad that would not fall apart as soon as it was washed and one that would fit our thick mattress. This is a great mattress cover fits great very soft and comfortable would definitely recommend
Coffee was great with every cup. This coffee maker makes coffee fast and keeps every cup hot. It's relatively easy to clean and definitely keeps the coffee hot. Makes a good cup of coffee. The coffee was easy to brew, but we found that the temperature of the coffee was too hot for most people. Very good coffee maker , coffee stayed hot &very easy to clean Good coffee. Coffee was good!
This is a great piece and easy to put together. Product as expected, I love it's color and it's a sold piece. Beautiful piece of furniture, nicely packaged and easy to assemble. The piece of furniture looks like the picture and matches great to the wood in my dining. Looks like a high quality piece, color is darker than shown in photo but was okay for me. The sideboard was very easy to put together, the easiest of any I have experienced, since the main part comes already assembled, and I think the styling and finish make the piece look like a much more expensive piece of furniture. easy assembly, sturdy piece. it looks great and was easy put together.
This fan makes a loud noise but is good because it gives the air I need. It’s a good fan and it blows air out more then I expected and it’s not loud. Fan is very loud, but moves a lot of air. Big, loud fan that moves a lot of air. It is definitely loud but I like white noise at night and this fan is only used in our room. I like the fan sound on when I sleep, so this fan is perfect because it’s not too loud, nor too quiet. It makes a fan moving air noise that I like. Fan works great plenty of power easy to assemble can be a bit loud.
Works okay but only for very small room. I use it in a small bathroom and it works great. Smaller than you think, it definitely works good but the space has got to be small, closet, small bathroom etc I looked to see what humidity level the 45-qt dehumidifier was reading in the room, and it was way up there, so it's not that there was no moisture in the room. It definitely works and pulls moisture out of the air, but it is best for small spaces (closet, maybe a small bathroom). This is very small but it pulls the humidity out of a small bathroom. just started using the Gurin dehumidifier in my rv and it works very well, small in size so it doesn't take up a lot of room, it's very quiet, glad I got this item. Its small and quiet and works very well.
The lids fit well and, because the trays are silicone, it's easy to remove individual ice cubes by pushing up from the bottom. Pros: - Lids fit and trays are stackable for freezing - Ice do indeed pop out by pushing the silicone bottoms - Good price for quality and amount Cons: - Lids don't quite fit if overfilled and iced over, or after popping some ice out - Takes a bit to pop the ice out (brace both hands on sides) Overall, satisfied with purchase. Don't buy; trays are very small, not easy to use as ice is hard to remove and there is only enuf ice per tray for one small glass. I like these ice trays but if you have any sort hand strength issues - you may have problems getting ice cubes loose. Unlike my old ice cub trays, the ice cubes come out easily and in one piece! It is very easy to pop out the ice cubes from these trays. The silicone bottom on these trays alleviates the need for twisting the tray to remove the cubes. My freezer doesn't have ice maker, so I have to use ice cube trays.
If you like the edges of the brownies you will love this brownie pan! The brownies this pan made had perfect edges (at least two on each brownie). It was easy to pour the brownie mix into the pan, and the coating on the pan made it so the brownies didn't stick at all and it was very easy to clean. Awesome brownie pan for those who like their brownies with edges and corners. With this pan every piece has an edge so the brownies go alot faster, I personally like the way they cook in this pan as each brownie ends up with some edge and some soft. ), the edges on brownies from this pan are the same texture as the rest of the brownie. This pan makes the best brownies ever, everybody loves the edges. now this is my favorite pan I love brownies and the edges are the best so now I get everything I want brownies and crisp edges the product bakes up great and the pan cleans up easy
Sturdy and great for baking cooling rack or oven crispy bacon or chicken wings! I needed a cooling rack that fit my toaster oven baking pan. This rack fits in my baking pan perfectly and cleans up easy in the dishwasher. Heavy duty, sturdy rack that fits perfectly in my baking pan. I needed a baking rack that was oven safe, and this one works perfectly. I needed a baking rack for cooking bacon in the oven. This rack fits my baking sheet perfectly and is very high quality! I needed baking rack that would fit my pan so I cook my bacon in the oven but not have it sit in its own fat.
i love my glass water kettle! I love this tea kettle, although the handle gets very hot so I use a oven mitten to pour water. We needed a simple kettle to heat up our water for coffee and tea each morning. Been using this kettle fine since I bought it back in Fall 2018, but went to heat up water like I've been doing since; the bottom of the kettle separated from the full body and hot water was now all over the stove and floor. I was a little bit worried about a glass tea kettle being extremely fragile, but it turns out I'm just not used to cooking with glass. I absolutely love this tea kettle! I did find an electric kettle that is all glass (the water doesn't touch any of the metal or plastic) so I am very happy with that one. I liked the all glass design of this kettle so much.
The bed is great now that it is put together. Bed was somewhat easy to put together. This bed was very easy to put together. this is a great, sturdy bed. Other then that the bed looks great and is very sturdy. This is a great, sturdy, bed. This bed is good and sturdy. Bed is sturdy, easy to assemble, and a good value.
We love having a coffee maker that can make one cup of coffee or a whole pot. This is great - she can have her pot of coffee and when I want a single cup later in the morning I can brew my k-cup - this is absolutely the perfect coffee maker Makes great coffee and i love the option of one cup or a pot of coffee. This coffee maker does exactly what it is supposed to do: serve a single K cup or a pot full of coffee. I want to love this coffee maker - it makes good coffee it's easy to use and it's super convenient with either the large pot which coffee nice and hot or the single serve coffee maker great for making single cups. Sometimes I only was one cup of coffee and with this machine I can do that. We can make a whole pot of coffee or just a single cup. This coffee maker has been trouble from day 1 , the coffee pot side will not keep the coffee warm , the single use pod side has issues , it blows up the pods on and off , leaves a mess with splash out when it does start to drip , don't buy this coffee combo machine .
I purchased the Excalibur dehydrator to primarily make beef jerky. I love to make Kale Chips, crackers, Tofu Jerky, granola and dry out my fruits (for healthy, cheaper snacks) in this dehydrator! This is hands down the best dehydrator I have owned, I love the timer and how you can adjust the temperature of the dehydrator, the 11.25 square feet of space makes it easy to dehydrate more food quicker, The horizontal design makes dehydrating a lot faster than vertical dehydrated. My kids loved the fruit leather and jerky coming out of this dehydrator. Fantastic dehydrator, love the jerky and other dehydrated food I've made with it. I have made a batch (10 lbs jerky every month) so far since I bought this dehydrator and it still works great. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT BEST DEHYDRATOR I HAVE EVER OWNED EASY TO CLEAN EASY TO WORK WITH I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT So far I love this dehydrator works great.I see people saying how noisy this unit is and I have to say it is not loud at all.All I here is a fan and it's not loud!
Having bought a unit for the loft room in 2019, we bought a second unit this summer of 2020 for a different room. You have to let it run all night if you want cool air but it's quite noisy. However nice cold air to cool the room. Otherwise keeps the room very cool, just too noisy to sleep with so i run it before bedtime, which works well. The chilly, It’s powerful, but noisy, cools lounge quickly, sleep mode makes it quieter, remote does everything you need to make yourself comfortable. Does cool a room reasonably quickly but is very noisy to leave on when sleeping. My personal opinion is that it's worth the noise for a nice cool room to sleep in. Good unit for the price, cool down my living space quickly.
The Lem Sausage Stuffer is a great product easy to use and easy to clean it performed better than the other machines I used, highly recommend this prduct. I used to use my Cabelas meat grinder but now after using the stuffer i will never be without a LEM Sausage stuffer again. I have been using the sausage stuffer attachment on my grinder for a couple years but finally got tired of messing with the cumbersome setup, so I purchased the LEM 5lb stuffer. WILL NOT PUSH SAUSAGE THRU CURVE IN STUFFER AND LEAKS AROUND PLUNGER CAN NOT PUSH HANDLE TO PUSH SAUSAGE MIX INTO CASINGS most sausage recipes are 5 pounds , I have enjoyed this 5 pound stuffer for that reason and more, it is easy to clean and does not require a lot of room etc. Had a 5 pound LEM Stuffer that worked great , upgraded to the 20 # Motorized stuffer and heave put it through its paces from sausage to snack sticks- never misses a beat, easy to clean wide range of speed adjustments Never own a sausage stuffer before so not sure what's the price range, but works great so I'm happy. I will never use my sausage grinder/stuffer again.
This product makes my hard wood floors in the kitchen, shine! This is the best product that I've found to put some shine into real hard wood floors. I have never used a product this good for wood floors. This product makes my wood floors look great! I used this product on my wood floors. Best product for my wood floors. After cleaning our wooden floors, this wood restorer leaves a beautiful clean shine and makes the floors look new! I cleaned my wood floors and then used product.
I love this set, the salt and pepper grinders both work really well, with adjustable settings for grind. Love these salt and pepper grinders, you can adjust the grind, easy to refill, and really all around great! Fantastic salt and pepper grinders, no mess, grind perfectly, wonderful as a gift. The cap to refill the grinders is set inside the part you twist to grind the pepper & salt. Providing a firm grip, as do all OXO products, these salt and pepper grinders have easy to adjust settings to grind virtually any variation from very fine to course. No mess, grind from the top salt & pepper grinders. Grinders work fine and after a couple of months they still grind away the rock salt and pepper in them. Both grinders grind the salt and pepper with ease.
This is a very nice sturdy shelf and it was easy to assemble I didn't even need the directions that's how easy it is to put together I would definitely buy again and I would definitely recommend this product 🥰 Perfect corner shelf that is so easy to put together and is sturdy. Easy to assemble, super cute corner shelf! It’s easy to put together and good fit if we put the shelf in the corner next the door. I needed a shelf for a small corner between my bed and the wall and thought this would be perfect. It doesn't look cheap, considering the price, you get a pretty nice corner shelf. This little corner shelf is such a great space saver, plus it’s easy to assemble and move! Pretty sturdy, very easy to assemble...fits in corner great and looks nice... doesn't look cheap...
2) When you pour the very last bit of wine (you are holding the decanter completely upside down) it tends to pour from the entire circle and unless you have a wine glass with a giant opening it spills. It is a nice decanter with nice shape, but it just too heavy to hold and pour the wine into the glass when there is not too much remaining. The decanter is attractive and does a good job with the wine. Don't buy the Wine Enthusiast Wine Decanter Glass stopper as it does not fit properly with this decanter. My only issue with it is that it is almost impossible to pour the wine into a wineglass without some of the wine trickling down the side of the decanter. Absolutely love this wine decanter. The wine Decanter I just purchased from Amazon. This is a very clean looking wine decanter.
I was looking for new mattress for my bed. After many months of sleep on this mattress I can say it is still very firm, for me that is great and I love it. I love this at mattress, it's so comfortable! Great price, mattress is so comfortable! It is a really nice mattress firm support that,I wanted well made slept on it last night a little chemical smell but gone this morning.This mattress is heavy so you may need help to get it in your house.Love it and the pillow that came with it. I’ve had this mattress for 4 years now and it is still very comfortable. This is a pretty firm mattress but very very comfortable. I first purchase a mattress back in 2015 which we love and it is still firm to this day.
This is the second iron I purchased from Rowenta, I had this iron lest then 1 year and the steam button stopped working. I have had a Rowenta steam iron for 20 years and I loved it. I purchased this iron for the steam power that Rowenta is known for. Best iron for steam ironing. Very high quality iron, great steam, even heat and heavy iron but feels light while ironing if that makes any sense. I keep the iron with water in it but the steam button stopped again. I LOVE THE IRON, but it uses so much steam. Love Rowenta irons since I'm one of the few people who iron everything, so you might as well have an iron that works well!
Saves space in my pantry, and the cans that fit, it's nice to have them drop down in the order I put them in. They are great for multiple sizes of cans and keep my pantry looking very organized. These are a little bulky but I can live with it since I have ordered 2 of them and will continue to order more as the cans start to overflow in the pantry. I love that I can keep the cans in the pantry sorted and rotated. Keeps my Pantry organized, easy set-up and holds and rotates cans very well It fits standard sized cans well but dosen't fit small cans very well (small cans sometimes get stuck) but i like it very much, I used 3 sets to fill 2 24" shelves in my pantry and combined 3 shelves of items into 2 shelves.I like that you can connect as many or as few as you want to fit any size cabinet. Easy to assemble, sturdy enough to hold all the cans. A great way to organize my cans in the pantry.
IF you are looking for a good set of pans this is the one. Good set of pans. I love my pots and pans set. Nice set of pots and pans! Very nice set of pans. What a nice set of pans. She likes them, a really nice set of pans for the price. I love the new set of pots and pans I ordered.
Spiralizer works great and it is easy to change blades and clean up. I love this spiralizer, it's easy to use, and very easy to clean. My spiralizer is easy to use, easy to clean and now the veggies add interesting and fun shapes to our meals! Easy to use, clean and store...I love this spiralizer! The next night I made Asian "noodles" out of zucchini and the spiralizer made it easy and convenient. This little spiralizer does a great job in making zoodles (zucchini noodles). I find it easy to assemble, easy to clean, and great with carrots, potatoes, zucchini, cukes and I want to try out a beet salad receipe I have using the spiralizer. Spiralizer is very easy to use and easy to clean.
Due to the double wall, the glasses were thicker than I like for a wine glass. We have always thought it would be nice to have insulated glasses and the wine glasses in actual glass. The glasses do not sweat and the wine stays cold. I bought these glasses as a replacement for a glass I had accidentally broken. These wine glasses have a quality feel about them. They are elegant, they keep beverage cold longer than other wine glasses. If the glass being 12 or 13 ounces doesn't matter, these are the glasses for you. I love these glasses because they keep my white wine cool even in the summer!
Great cutting board, heavy and sturdy. This is a beautifully made & very heavy butcher block cutting board. The cutting board is thick and heavy enough to stay in place while using it. I'm for sure satisfied and would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a thick solid bamboo cutting board this definitely surpasses my other cutting boards Nice heavy and thick cutting block. This cutting board is sturdy, well made and quite beautiful to look at. Good looking cutting boards, good enough to use as a serving board. My other cutting board doesn't do this, so it's definitely this block.
We own a set of All-Clad Copper Core cookware but decided this size pan would be handy to add to our collection. This All-Clad saucepan is Copper Clad cored and heats up very fast and when the flame is lowered it cools down very fast as well. The copper goes not only on the bottom but up the sides of the pan resulting in very even cooking. All-Clad is such wonderful cookware and the copper core adds exponentially -- I know, because my father was a mechanical engineer who, at one point in his life, worked for a cookware company and had a set of copper core pans made for my mom. Am slowly replacing all my old cookware with the all-clad copper core ones. All-Clad SS Copper Core box contained a Cuisinart sauce pan with All-Clad paperwork Previous order for same item came in an All-Clad box with a Chinese saucepan. We bought this pan to replace a Revere copper bottom pan that we wore out over aout 30 years of use. I have a collection of the All-Clad Copper Core cookware and it never disappoints.

I’ve been using Sperry for years and next to me Sperrys they don’t look as nice and the quality is not the same. Sperry is the best brand of boat shoes and these are one of the best styles because its all finished leather and they will hold up to the elements around your feet much better than the suede or microfiber tops on some of Sperry's models. This is my 3rd pair of Sperry boat shoes over the years and I have always been extremely pleased with them. Have worn Sperry for years but this pair is definitely not the quality I would expect. Of course now I'm out $100 and a pair of shoes. Fits as expected to me- maybe a bit wide but I may have ordered a bit too wide but good color, good fit, its a Sperry. I have worn Sperry Boat Shoes for many years and hey have lasted well until this pair! I have found these Sperry boat shoes to look great and to be extremely comfortable.
I wear size 6 in the US so these fit great. If you wear UGGs, you know they are not true to size and you have to find your perfect size. I love my new slippers they fit great and are very comfortable. Love Ugg slippers especially these version. I'm a women's size 7 and the size 5 fit perfect. I'm usually a size 6/7 in women's but a size 4-5 in UGGs One was a size 7 and the other a 6. SIZE.
If they fit they would be very comfortable shoes. These shoes are very comfortable and look great. great shoes, very comfortable. These shoes are very comfortable! I like these comfortable shoes.

I don't run, but like running shoes because they are not heavy like walking shoes. These are the most comfortable shoes! Great running shoe and everyday shoe. These are great running shoes.
Now that I have the right size I LOVE these shoes. The only problem is they do run big, I'm usually a size 7 and I ordered a 6.5 since the other reviews said to go half a size down but they still are big on me, I couldn't return them since I'm not from the US but I would recommend to go a full size down, other than that the shoes are really pretty. The shoes are really cute but offer no arch support and run half a size to a full size big. Really cute but way too big in the back where the heel is. I wear 1/2 size down Over all, really cute shoes for a relatively good size. They are very cute and look really nice on but It just seems too big at the heel area. Love the looks of the shoe but I had to send it back three times my regular size was too large the next size they slipped in the back the smaller size too tight this shoe is not for me

Seems like a good shoe, however they are much too narrow for my feet. Probably good for a narrow foot. Great minimalist shoe, I have narrow feet so the fit is good. I buy Asics all the time and these run a little narrow compared to others I've had. I have narrow feet, always an 8 in Asics products. Perfect shoe for someone with narrow feet.

Fitbit app works great - the watch itself DOES NOT!! What I don't like is that the fitbit versa 2 app does not always sink with the watch like it should. If you are looking for a smart watch with fitness tracking, look no further then the Fitbit Versa 2. This was my 3rd Fitbit fitness tracker watch and I’m so disappointed with the issues of my Fitbit Versa 2. The Fitbit battery is so much better and has all of the features I used on the Apple Watch. Fitbit is THE best tracker watch you can buy...at any price. I am absolutely loving my new fitbit versa 2 watch. I love my fitbit, I finally found what I was looking for in a watch.
I got this belt to hold my phone and keys when I run. This is a great belt, both for running and when I don't feel like carrying a bag but have to hold my phone, keys, and whatever else. I got this belt to hold my phone while I'm out on the road, running. Are use this flip belt to go running and carry my phone and car keys. I mainly use this for when I run and stick my phone, keys, and ID in the belt. Great running belt, no bounce and phone is always secure I can barely notice the belt when running, my phone doesn't move at all. The belt is comfortable and held my phone just fine.
Perfect Little Bag. This bag is perfect! This bag is perfect! This bag is perfect and only $5!! This is the perfect bag for that! The bag was perfect. This bag is a great size. This bag is a great size!!
I needed an umbrella that was huge and could stand up to rain and wind. This is a great product for anybody looking to stay dry in rain and for a sturdy umbrella. The umbrella broke down due to heavy wind and rain it's not windproof if you're thinking that This is a very nice umbrella and perfect for the rain and wind in Chicago... Lastly, this umbrella was able to protect me and several others in rain and wind that was quite heavy. Nice large umbrella, big enough for two persons, less problem with strong wind This umbrella is easy to use, sturdy in the wind and big enough to share. Haven’t tested it in the rain but this auto open ‘wind proof’ umbrella certainly looks the part
My 2 year old son LOVES basketball and his other hoop set was getting too small. My grandson loves it, he wants everybody to play basketball with him. He's 7 years old and loves to play basketball, thoughhe cant move the hoop up and down yet he's been playing with it every day. I bought this hoop for my basketball loving three year old grandson Simon. Great sturdy basketball hoop. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves playing basketball! And in a few short years she will be able to play hoop with the big kids! Wonderful, sturdy hoop Our 4 year old and his 16 year old brother love it The basement is their "court"
We used this tent on a night where it was going to rain and we had never set it up before. We put 2 twin mattresses on one end of the tent for us - - kids on the other of the tent and still plenty of room to get in the door, store our stuff and move around. This tent has lots of room and was pretty easy to set up with 2 people. The door is set pretty high, it makes it very easy to trip getting in and out, not a good tent for little kids. This tent wasn’t too easy to set up the first time. The tent is easy for two people to set up. Overall, great tent and easy to set up. Great tent easy to set up.
I like this tent, I have only been camping twice and it was super easy to set up. It's a good tent, easy to assemble, keeps the rain out well, will purchase a 3 person + tent in the future. This tent is easy to set up and had plenty of room for 2 people. Great tent, easy set up. It's a great tent and very easy to set up. bought this tent for a camping trip and was impressed with how easy it was to set up and take down. This tent was so easy to put together and just as easy to take down. This was an easy tent to set up.

The bike was easy to assemble. Great bike, takes some time to assemble but not more than you would think and it makes it a solid bike. I like the bike, but I keep sliding off the seat, they should fix that, other than that the quality of the bike is great, I been using it for about 3 months now. Overall - good bike.
If you need a nice stable squat rack and pull up bar, this is right for you.It can handle a good amount of weight and is easy to assemble. There may be more solid pull up bars out there, but for this price, this rack is a good deal. Solid squat rack and pull up bar. This is a great Squat rack/Pull up bar! Was looking for a durable rack for my home for squats and pull ups. Works well (I use it for pull ups, not squat rack) but a little difficult to put together. I had to use my own tools but all in all this rack is very easy to assemble and it is really sturdy. I weigh 230 for pull ups and rack weight up to 315 it's does a great job.
Really good gloves the padding is great and the wrist support is excellent. Best lifting gloves I've owned, good padding, good grip. Good grip and fit best lifting gloves I have ever had This is the second pair of these gloves that I've ordered and was disappointed to see that the rubber grip broke apart in less than a week. I purchased my first pair of Best Grip gloves a couple of years ago and have been impressed with the quality and durability of the gloves. The padding inside the wrist wrap could be a little more comfortable but overall they're the best gloves I've ever used hands down These gloves have great wrist support, lots of padding, and look nice. Gloves work as advertised, excellent wrist support as well as thick padding for hands.
good quality ball, nice bright color,my son love it. Child size soccer ball is good quality and my 8 year old daughter loves it.

This is the best mask you can ever get it is a lot of money but when you get it you will be so pleased with your purchase and it is also amazing for airsoft BUY THIS MASK This mask works awesome and its super light and i recommend it to anyone. The mask has an amazing color and covers the face perfectly. My Dye mask has worked fantastically, no fogging in this mask where my last "fogless" goggles fogged constantly. Mask is comfortable and is extremely hard to fog up if you can even fog it up. Mask won't fog up, but watch out getting shot in the mouth!
Garmin vívosmart HR Activity Tracker is a one for everything wrist worn device that is an alarm, a pedometer, a calorie counter, as well as heart rate monitor. This is my second Garmin vivosmart Activity Tracker, I loved my first Garmin, but wanted an activity tracker that also tracked my heart rate. Garmin vivosmart HR is very accurate on distance but heart rate is not. Love the Garmin Vivosmart HR Tracker enough, that this one was for my daughter, I have one I love, and a friend I gave one to loves hers. I've had the Garmin Vivosmart HR Activity Tracker for a month or so now, and it has been a good purchase. I would highly recommend this fitness tracker if you want to track your steps and your heart rate. Garmin vivosmart HR activity tracker is a very helpful exercise watch for budget minded person. I'm very happy with my Garmin HR activity tracker.
My son is a pitcher and needs an accurate speed gun. This speed gun was very quick and accurate when checking car speeds. This radar gun is accurate down to 1 mph when compared to fixed position speed guns I've tried. The speed of the gun was not accurate, and when I measured it, I found it was not the same as the real speed. First use of gun for baseball - pitching speed was -10 mph off from pro gun. This speed gun is a good deal and it works so good and it is what I have been looking for. This speed gun works great! The Bushnell Velocity Radar Speed Gun works great for monitoring my son and his baseball throwing speed (pitching velocity) as well as ball speed off the bat.
Bike is very easy to put together!! Great workout bike for the price, and easy to put together! This is a great bike for the price. Great bike for the price. A plus for this bike is the seat back, so comfortable! Great price ,great bike! Good bike however. Good bike.
Great batting gloves the best pair my son has worn thus far... He loves these batting gloves so much it's his second pair. My son is 12 and has large hands, so needs adult gloves. My son loves these gloves. They fit well and have a little more padding in the palm that other gloves, she really likes that. Lately, I have found that most batting gloves do not have leather palms, these glove do. I purchased these batting gloves to use as a casting glove for fishing. These gloves look cool, but were too small for my son.
Only issue is battery doesn't hold charge that long after a year of use. My 4 year old grandson loves this.. great value for small kids ! Bought this for our 7 year old son for Christmas last year and he loves it. My 5 and 6 year old kids love it. Great little buggy.... Quick and very easy to drive... Drives on grass or pavement and the charge lasts enough to keep the kids interested My 5 year old son loves this buggy. You will have to change those and the battery after a year or so. 6 year old son loves it.
Love my pilates ring, easy to use and came with a good exercise manual I found this 12 inch ring a perfect size to do all the Pilates exercises at the gym. This is a great solid work out Pilates Ring - I like it and especially love the color. My Physical Therapist recommended the Pilates Ring for exercises that will strengthen my SI joint. I started doing more pilates and find this fitness ring to be helpful in enhancing my workouts allowing me to get deeper into the exercise. Love this Pilates ring. Love my Pilates ring! I really love this pilates ring!
The grill served its purpose well I use it for camping and I'm going to be using it for hunting this fall it's very easy to set up and very easy to use that makes cooking so much simpler If you like to cook over an open fire, then this is the grill to use. Had to get a file for the hole on the metal piece that allows you to adjust the height of the grill from the fire. Perfect for camping and cooking over a fire. Perfect for camping and cooking over the fire... adjusts easily and stores easily out of the way It’s perfect for campfire cooking since you can adjust the height of the pan/pot over the fire. The grill tripod works well but was sent without the adjusting tab that goes on the leg to move the grate up and down. Lantern hanger piece does not fit the leg of the tripod and you have to fight to move it along the pole to change the height of the grill
I bought these skates for my daughter only 3 months ago and she just called me from the skating rink to let me now the boot of the skate pulled of the soles of the skate. My daughter is a size 8.5 in shoes and bought size 9 skates. I purchased these skates for my daughter for a learn to skate course. I bought these skates for my daughter who just learning to skate. My daughter is one her third pair of these skates (most recently a size 11 for a 5 year old) and they have been great. these were perfect ice skates for my daughter who had been ice skating a few years ago and just started up again. Skates were the correct size by the measurement chart and the soft skate feature made them comfortable. Theses skates are comfortable, fit as expected and loved them so much I ordered a pair for my daughter!
good little duck call, the sound is very nice and easy to blow. I would recommend this call over all duck calls under $40, and it is comparable to the Double Nasty duck call (which is less expensive, but good too). I'm not a hunter, and certainly no duck or call expert, but I can make it sound well enough like the ducks. Not sure if it will freeze up in cold weather yet, but this duck call is a value for the sound quality it produces. First duck call and found it very easy to use and great sounds from it This duck call was easy to use and makes accurate sounds. My husband loves this Duck call. This call was very easy to blow out of the package and created a sound that sounded just like a duck was in the house!
WOD jump rope looks nice and comes with a spare cable, can be cut to adjust length. Super light weight wire, but straight forward jump rope and easy to adjust and use... Just wish the cable was a little heavier. Easy to adjust and cut jump rope steel cable to your size. Great product, two ropes, smooth and fast rotations....best jump rope I have had and I have tried many! Good fast jump rope, comes with an extra cable. Great jump rope I like it a lot good price and you give a extra cable good deal works good IMHO, the Rx Smart Gear Rope is the Holy Grail of ropes for double unders but if you don't want to spend a ridiculous $45 on a rope, then the WOD Nation Rope is the very best value out there. I purchased this rope because the ropes at the gym were too long for me and I wanted to have a rope sized just for me as I have a goal of learning double unders.
The gauge on my pump never worked though. Gauge is nice to have on the pump. Pump worked well and pressure gauge is pretty accurate. Pump worked well and pressure gauge is pretty accurate. Great bike pump. The pump works great, is compact and seems very well made. The pump works but is not easy to use. I got the product and didn't know how to pump up my own tire.
My older Penn reels are smooth and easy to reel, my Shims on reels are smooth and easy to reel. Tough reel , 15#’s drag decent medium to lite duty reel I normally use Shimano 4000 reels but decided to try this Penn. Never bought a really high dollar reel but I couldn't imagine it being any better than the penn battle 2 this reel is super smooth and powerful. Nice little reel for inshore or bay fishing the drag system is a major upgrade over the lesser Penn reels and it’s quite smooth. Happy so far smooth reliable and gets me out fishing since my old reel wasn't working Great reel for fishing near shore, very smooth and drag worked perfectly. This is one of Penn's top of the line reels and would recommed this to anyone I've just had this reel for about a month and have landed more fish with this reel because of drag system on it. How can I return this for a smaller size PENN battle fishing reel.
Bought this skates for my daughter not true size I adjusted to size 9 and the inner part (blue) did not got any bigger sad because the material is good quality and my daughter really like them They fit great and the size is perfect. I don’t think can be fit more than size 2 feet. My 8 year old wears a size 3 shoe, but she has the skates set on size 5 to be comfortable.They won't last as long as I had hoped. My daughter wears a size 3, so I got the size 2-5, and it fitted her kind of small even when the rollerblades were set on size 5. He is size 6 and they fit perfect Son and daughter loves the skates. The are adjustable to size and fit well.
this is my second cap kettlebell and like the 40 lbs bell this one has a wide handle allowing a comfortable grip. I already had a 35lb Go Fit Kettlebell, but when I needed a second one, a single Bell from the Go Fit brand was almost as expensive as a pair of the higher quality Cap Kettlebells. This is what a kettlebell should be: made of metal, easy to handle, smooth for the hands. It does have a slightly wider handle than my other kettlebell (10 pounds) but I have no problems grasping the handle for exercises. Shipping was delayed, to no fault of the seller, however I was very disappointed to find that my kettle bell’s coating had a defect on the handle that is very sharp making the kettlebell unsafe for use. This Kettlebell is compact, smooth and the handle is perfect. Quality kettlebell with a good handle. The grip/handle is wide enough for me to do kettlebell swings with both hands (although I don't have huge hands - if you had enormous hands, I could see this being an issue).
Having used many water gloves, these are the most realistic feeling in the water. Although these gloves can be a little difficult to get on and off (best done in the water), once on they stay put. These gloves almost fit like they were built just for my hand! My husband liked these gloves a lot, they were easy to put on in water and made quite a workout out of casual swimming in a pool. I use them for swimming and I've been looking for pulling gloves that didn't have the fingers tips cut off because I hate how the water gets in when I do freestyle but these gloves solved that problem. Love to swim with my new gloves. These gloves really make a swim a good workout by incorporating all the muscles that normally don't get worked as much with normal swimming. The gloves work as advertised.
The third pot of coffee the glass top broke and left glass on the coffee basket. the glass lip on the lid broke off into the coffee pot lid off to fill with water and coffee. I been looking for" Percolator Glass Knob" for the coffee pot with know luck . I Love this coffee pot, except the glass piece on top broke and can not be replaced. The glass top does not fit, the lid does not fit and the design prevents coffee from percolating and just burns (to where it just boils away) the water or coffee in the pot. Love the color of the coffee pot but it was flimsy and when we made coffee for the first time, the glass bulb burst. I received my Coleman 14-Cup Coffee Enamelware Percolator and was impressed with the weight of the pot. I loved the coffee pot until the glass top broke while brewing a pot of coffee.
Put on AR rifle and I have shot about 100 rounds and the scope has held sight picture. This scope gives a good clear sight picture and was easy to install holds up well and so far accurate Good compact scope for the price, have it mounted on a AR platform with quick connect mounts. Crystal clear scope, easy to zero, holds zero perfect, a good product just wasn't what I was looking for at100 yards. I mounted this scope in a matter of 5 minutes, took it to the range, fired 3 rounds at 50 yards with a 1 inch group. Great cheap scope to mount on AR or rifle. Pretty good scope for the money, good out to 100 yards with no problem...... changing review to 2 stars, 500 rounds latter it won't hold zero. the scope is clear all the way at 9 power a great buy for AR rifles.
The lacrosse balls arrived quickly and the color is great! My son is just starting to play lacrosse but these balls seem to be great. Who knew lacrosse balls came in so many great colors!? Love the quality of these Lacrosse balls. These are great solid lacrosse balls. These lacrosse balls are very good quality. The lacrosse balls are high quality, and we used them in practice right away. I take my lacrosse balls to the dog park with my pooch, very often a dog at the park discovers these balls and is very reluctant to give it up.
Awesome gloves, great quality, great feel, really good wrist support. Would recommend these to anyone who's looking for some good quality gloves. The plus side is my wife got a new pair of gloves and they fit her hands great. The gloves are very nice looking but the glove is starting to fall apart I have only had them for about 2 months, wrist support is very unsteady compared to my other gloves. Quality is very good but the gloves are very small. I'm 5'1" and these gloves fit perfectly for my small hands. These are good quality gloves. Good quality gloves.
I would recommend anyone looking to get a great bench at a good price this is the one! Assembly was pretty easy and the bench itself is pretty sturdy. easy to assemble, Especially good for someone who wants a solid bench. Its definitely a good buy for someone looking to get a bench if you get it for a good price. Extremely good weight bench and at a very good price. Great bench, worth a purchase and very easy to put together if you can follow the simple instructions. This bench allows the leg and arm workout with comfort, easy assembly Honestly a very good bench for the price and pretty straight forward assembly.
I use the belt to hold my phone when running. So for now my keys go in my running shorts and my phone in the belt, and I'm happy :) Great belt for running or wearing at the gym to hold your phone. I run with my phone inside of the belt and wear it on the small of my back. I never carry my phone with me running but I figured I'd try it out with the belt. This belt has some stretch and was able to fit my phone, keys and running fuel. This belt is very comfortable and holds my phone securely while I run. This is a true iPhone or other large phone work out belt.
It's a great umbrella, love not getting my car all wet when I get inside of rain storm it's so easy The umbrella was very pretty but the first time I used it, in pouring down rain, I got in my car and it would not close. I love this umbrella so much, does not drip rain all over you when you fold it up and the handle makes it easy to handle several items at the same time. I like the umbrella because you dont get wet when folding down,and getting in the car.i like the handle . The best thing is getting in my car in the rain with my Umbrella, but keeping my car dry. The rain is nicely kept inside the folded umbrella to keep your car dry. Umbrella handles very well especially coming in and out of your car in heavy rain I thought the umbrella would be larger, the design of the handle is useless - you can't stand the umbrellas to keep the water from pouring out.
It has foam padding on all the grips unlike other pull up bars and the door bar has padding on it also to prevent damage to the door! Pull up goals - love having this bar convenient in my door way - I can do pull-ups whenever I want. Compared to other over the door pull up bars that I've seen, this is by far the best quality. I’m very disappointed because this looked like a great, solid pull up bar, but it just doesn’t fit on normal door frames. Easy assembly and very easy to fit to almost any door. It is very sturdy and works in my door frame great. it fit my regular size door perfectly and its very sturdy with good grips. I've hesitated to buy a doorway bar for some time now because I've seen what they do to door frames.
Make sure you have a ball pump on hand if you want to be able to use these balls. Description says it comes with a ball pump... the tiny plastic ball pump included did not have any attachment to actually pump up the balls... so now I have to go out and buy a ball pump... not cool at all! The needle broke into the ball during pumping the very first time we used it on the balls. Pump is very weak, but balls seem to be good quality. We have had these balls for 6 months and they no longer inflate and keep air. The pump that comes with the balls is cheap but adequate. Balls came with a pump but the pump had no tip so there was no way to blow the balls up The balls are just what I expected but, the pump that came with them is AWFUL!!
My son, who's put tires on his bike before, could not get this tire to go on the rim. Also, these tires work great and keep tire puncture/flat tires reduced by 80% vs. regular bike tire. I can't say how long these tires will last but the tire quality appears pretty good. Tire was exact replacement for tires on the bike. Look really nice on my wifes bike.Would definitely by these tires for my next tire replacement. Excellent replacement tire with a very smooth ride compared to the stock tires that came on the bike. I ordered two tires to replace my old tire. They are good tires, actually doing what a tire is suppose to do.
The scale is accurate and I love how it tracks your weight right in the FitBit app. Setup was easy it took 3 minutes to sync scale with WIFI and add it to my Fitbit account. My husband and I use this scale to sync with our FitBit and to track on our app. I love how this scale syncs to the Fitbit app. This scale is very accurate and I love that I am able to sync it to my smartphone with the fitbit app to track my progress. This scale is completely integrated into the Fitbit and everything syncs perfectly with my iPhone, Fitbit, and My Fitness Pal. I love my Fitbit and the scale makes it that much better. I love my fitbit scale.
Standard burlap sacks that both 200lb adults all the way down to 35lb children got great use out of for a party. Nice size sacks for kids at the picnic who had a good time in the sack race. These burlap sacks were great for our family sack race. There are lots of places to buy burlap sacks for potato sack races, but many of them where so inexpensive, I was worried they'd rip. These sacks are perfect for fun filled sack race. Best of all was that the sacks are sturdy and our kids will have lots of fun...and the adults too. These burlap sacks were great for potato sack races. Got these sacks for kids to enjoy potato sack races.
I wear compression socks daily because they normally make my legs feel great. I love compression socks, my legs feel great wearing them. Compression socks aren’t fun to wear when you are on your feet all day and they are hot. She has been wearing compression socks for three years now for swelling in her legs. They are definitely compression socks but they fit a little large for someone with thin legs. But then I wear a pair of compression socks all day long. He has bad swelling in his legs and feet and compression socks were suggested for him. I would recommend these socks for anyone looking for medium compression that is comfortable to wear all day long.
Picture is very clear and surprisingly good for a scope in this price range. Super Clear Scope at 300 Yards, at Dusk or Dawn and anywhere in between!! For the price, it is an excellent scope.Bright clear view. Why spend more for a scope than a rifle if not shooting past 300 yards. I will always go with Bushnell every time they are high quality and in the "working man's price range" great scope! Excellent, clear and bright scope. Good, clear scope. however when compared to more expensive scopes you can definitely tell the glass this scope uses is not the best.
Since we have to stay at home, I missed my gym workout and the bosu ball is what I use to train so now I got it and started using it as I miss my balance practice and core work. So I purchased the Bosu balance trainer to use with my home workouts, for stability, balance and more. I had used a Bosu Balance Trainer at my gym. I found the Bosu ball easy to inflate with the included pump and plug. I’m 74 years old and have been using the Bosu balance trainer at my gym for the last five years. My husband used the bosu ball daily for balance exercises. Love training with the Bosu ball - it's the perfect addition to a home workout. Just got my bosu ball to workout at home since the gym is closed.
After you have good wheels, bearings and cushions all you have to spend is $40 on these bullet skates when your child grows into the next size(get rid of the wheels and bearings that they come with the skates because they are junk)and they react and roll like a more expensive skate. I've had parts of the skate fall off with only a few uses and even after tightening the skates feel uneven and it's not the wheels. I'm giving these skates 2 stars.... low because the toe stop does NOT grip, and caused some problems.... high because the tight and wide wheels were helpful to my young children who taught themselves to skate (slowly) in these skates. If you allow the trucks to flex, the wheels dig into the skate and wears out the sole of the skates. He really loves these skates and all he had to do was oil the wheels and they will fly. very happy, good skates, exactly as described, I love them.they are new and the perfect fit, they look good and skate very smooth, the stoppers work really well also. THESE skates look like something you'd wear around town if it weren't for the wheels. the wheels are super hard , there is no give in the skates at all I've used them twice since I purchased them
These knee sleeves keep compression on my knees and make my squats feel super stable. I bought these knee sleeves to help support my knees while lifting heavy fire hose at work, and they work great. I am extremely happy with these Knee sleeves, they fit my knees tight, and when I squat heavy they really help me on my knees. Very happy with the knee sleeves, they do a great job of keeping the knees warm during workouts and the little extra support results in a more confident squat. I'm new to knee sleeves, I have bad knees and when I squat I wrap them when I go up in weight. At almost 60 my knees are feeling the years & I am very happy with these knee sleeves. These are some of the best knee sleeves he has used and really provides the support he needs when lead lifting and doing squats. For keeping my knees warm while squatting, these knee sleeves are great.
This is a great professional tennis racket for a real good price on Amazon well strong nice grip easy on the handle This is a low cost, light weight tennis racket for beginners. This tennis racket is light weight and feels comfortable. This tennis racket is really great, I use it every weekend.It is solid, light weight and comfortable. It is listed as a beginners racket, which I thought would be appropriate for him since he is just learning how to play tennis. I'm returning to tennis as an older adult so I wanted to find a racket that has a larger head, comfortable grip, lightweight, and a good size sweet spot. I am a beginner tennis player and have really enjoyed this racket! It is what it is, a cheap beginner tennis racket.
First goggles that Fit my 5 year old daughter. My 6 year old is in swim lessons and needed a quality pair of goggles that is easy for her to put on & adjust herself without help. My 8 year old daughter is on the summer swim team and loves these goggles. My 7 year old daughter loves these goggles. These goggles fit my 7, 4, and 2 year old. My 6 and 8 year old girls tried swim team this year and these are the only goggles they would wear. These goggles fit my two year old and a friend's four year old. We ordered these goggles for our (then) 6 year old, mainly for swim lessons and also for over the summer at the pool, and the strap BROKE less than 3-4 months after purchasing them, (and probably less than 12 times in the water).
Very nice sound and the hat is warm. hat quality is nice, easy to use, good sound quality, but has a difficult flaw. Hat is constructed of very nice material, fits well and the sound is pretty good. it fits bulky on the ears and the sound can be heard outside of the hat. The sound is pretty awesome and the hat was good quality and very handsome. my son in law loved this gift, the sound was great The hat is so nice, great sound and easy to setup! I like the sound quality and fit of this hat, but it’s glitchy when it comes to turning it off.
Just be sure you find the two by four studs in the wall and this bar works perfect very sturdy I like the padding vs another wall mounted pull up bar without it. The Wall Mounted pull Bar is well constructed and well design. You need more distance from the pull up bar and the wall. Good sturdy bar. If you have the space on your wall this is the bar to buy! This dip station and their wall mounted pull up bar. Strong and sturdy pull up bar.
