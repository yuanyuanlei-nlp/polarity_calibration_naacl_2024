I'm Planing in getting another one for my living room TV!! For some reason it ’ s Onlt for Netflix. Works great!!! You will need an extra Roku for each TV. Easy to install. We cut the Cable & strictly stream. Easy to set up. And now I have Netflix on my non smart TV. Love Roku ... Great streaming device. Turned an old Hdtv into a smart TV. Can use it for Amazon prime and Netflix. I love the Roku. This is our second Roku.
Had questions. So much for that...very disappointing, as it was an awesome TV right up to that point. Big and incredibly beautiful. My 7 year old Samsung was a better TV! Great TV. I am very happy with the TV. That also means the TV remote could be used instead of their Remotes. Apple TV built in. Bought the 65 ” ..... very happy with this TV. Great picture. The picture is awesome. I love this TV. The TV was delivered on the date that I picked. We love it - the picture is so clear, bright, with vivid colors.
They block out most of the noise. They are comfortable, easy to store, and the battery life is good. Very comfortable in the ear. Personally, I like the ear buds. This is my second pair. Sound quality is excellent. I have used them on the plane and the noise level was very low. C'mon Bose, you can do better than that. The noise cancelling is amazing! Calm and clear sound of music. Get the over the ear Headphones instead: I ’ ve tried both these Bose Earbuds and the Bose Headphones on the same flight. I love Bose. Plus they are small and fit in the ears instead of Headphones.
Great processor! Pros: good single core performance. This Cpu is a beast. It runs cool, is stable and does all I need for it to do and more. I have not Overclocked it that much. Very fast Cpu. No tinkering required and no silly De-Lidding. I upgraded from my old I7 QUAD core 2.8 Ghz Cpu to this one and it has been a fantastic jump in speed. The best chip for gaming. This thing runs hot. This thing boots in no time, runs games at Max settings, smooth as silk. I did try the 9700K, came back to the 8700K hyper thread processor, my applications were sluggish with the 9700K even Overclocked to 5.0 Ghz. First Cpu that actually Overclocked without issues for me although application I run don't need it, so I dont' run it over clocked.
Now I have t take photos at the same level of competence as the camera! I have pushed this camera to its limits and taken photos of everything I could find. Not sure if this was a “ Backfocusing “ issue or just a lemon. It's helped me shoot in low light situations for when I'm hired for Events/Clubs. We love this canon 5D Mark IV camera. The touch screen is superb. Irish professional wedding photographer this is a beast of a camera the quality is mind blowing. This is the best camera I have ever had in my life. I enjoy shooting landscapes and Astrophotography and have been wanting a full frame camera for awhile. Love this camera! I used this camera for almost a month. This is a major upgrade for me from my Mkii. This camera does great in low light situations as well.
I own several Aoc monitors for work (4) but this portable one was a no go. At first a few Pixels started to just be white and now half the screen is white and its worthless. Works great in windows! It is light weight and travels well with its Neoprene sleeve and fits into my computer backpack with my laptop. It's an excellent addition to my portable computing gear! Fits in my laptop bag. Great monitor. The Usb function failed on the monitor. Plug and play. The screen is bright, has good contrast, and overall easy on the eyes. I use as a third screen when needed. Item is Non-Compatible with windows 10. I love this monitor. Great for travel or home.
Tv picture and main board went out less than eight months in. Love this smart TV!!!! Got this on prime day and I love it! The picture quality is excellent! Amazon nor best buy will help. I just Unplugged it and plugged it back in (had to do that a few times with the fire TV box). Do not buy this TV! It's especially great for those who watch Netflix/Hulu/Amazon and play Video games! Great picture. The picture is amazing. Great TV!!! I love this TV. One of the least expensive 50" smart TV's on the market. This TV is great excluding the fact that it isn ’ t really a “ smart ” TV.
Apple play works well. Love this radio. The apple Carplay is fantastic! We wanted him to have the features of apple car play and this works fantastic. Great radio! It sounds great with the factory speakers too. I didn't realize when I bought it, but I prefer a volume knob rather than Up/Down buttons. Installed in a 03 F150. Very easy to install. Great head unit. Love the apple car play. Works great. Touch screen is nice. Great product, can ’ t get anything better for this price and it has a Cd/Dvd Player built in which is rare nowadays.
Slingbox saved me from not seeing U.S. TV. This will be my last sling product. According to Slingbox Website, Workaround is a Hdmi converter box for $70 that was not available at time of review. I use it to watch football games in my home market. This box is connected to an ATT Uverse receiver at home and I did not find any particular problem in setting it up. I paid for the product at full price!!! As soon as I can afford it, I will be reselling my Slingbox somewhere and looking for an alternative. You have to pay for the Iphone and Ipad Apps but worth the cost. Do not buy. It requires a Download from Slingbox for setup, at least. I will no longer buy or upgrade any Slingbox products. It's nice in theory...being able to watch your own TV anywhere. So far the product has been excellent. The sling box grabs the signal and broadcasts over Wifi.
My portraits look so sharp. The auto focus is smooth and accurate. Has a great depth of field. This lens does not disappoint. I am so happy with this lens! Beautiful background Blurring / Bokeh. Fantastic lens for the money. I love this lens. She loves this lens. Great for portrait photography. I'm an amateur photographer. This lens is a Must-Have for the gear locker. Great lens. Takes beautiful pictures.
One of the best pair of Headphones I have purchased. Great sound. Bluetooth range is very good, left my phone downstairs and went upstairs with no loss. Excellent sound and very comfortable to wear. Headphones very stylish and the Bass is unbelievable, along with the sharpness in the treble. Battery life is better than expected. The noise cancellation is really bad! The battery life is also very good. Quality Headphones at a good price. Battery lasts a V long time. The sound is amazing. They seem very well made with quality materials, the ear cups especially comfortable. They are so Comfy and the sound quality is excellent and he now says makes our other speakers sound rubbish. These are an excellent set of Headphones.
Love the style, aluminum Shell, 14 inches monitor, and decent resolution. I can use Chromeos for web browsing and Online school and Linux for everything else. The battery life is impressive. The battery life is great. This Chromebook feels like it was built as military grade. I love this computer. I love this Chromebook. Blazing fast and an almost instant start up! Wish it had an SD card slot. It's not unusable but doesn't feel high quality and doesn't really feel 100% responsive. It has gotten a couple of updates since I first purchased it and it now supports Android Apps. The screen is great. This is a great laptop. This was a nice computer for the price!
This camera is great! The free 7 day cloud storage is Unbeatable. It constantly Disconnects from Smarthings and I have to reset the camera. This is for the Arlo Q wired camera. Great to keep an eye on my car and Kayaks. Very easy to setup. I love this camera. But the motion detection is annoying. The night vision is great for our garage and the ability to set specific trigger zones was super simple. The Video quality is great. There is a 8 second delay on my live view but I am blaming my Internet connection. Easy way to keep an eye on my home. The night vision is awesome.
The picture on this television is great! The Android and remote can be slow to respond sometimes but nothing major. Great TV. Works great with apple TV and watching movies in Hdr. Great picture! The picture quality is awesome. Hdr and Dolby vision. The picture quality is really nice as well. I love this TV. Also bought the sound bar. Beautiful picture. The picture quality is amazing. Picture quality is outstanding.
Plus I can also use my wife ’ s existing Nikon lens collection:). With the manual, Onboard guide system, and overall layout, it's very easy to learn how to use everything available on this camera. There is no memory card with it if you were wondering so get your own SD card Seperatly. I love this camera. This camera rules, def is a must buy! Beautiful images and fairly easy to use. I am a novice photographer at best. I couldn't because it was out of stock at the time. My last Slr was a Nikon N70 film camera. Great camera! I just got this camera and I'm really Obsessing over it. I am glad I did! Takes great pictures.
The battery life is great. Great sound. The Bass is deep and the Speaker is loud. It's a Bose! I listen to them daily. Absolutely great Bluetooth Speaker by Bose. Easy to pair in stereo with the Bose App. The sound is amazing. Great Speaker! The sound quality is great. I love this Speaker. 3 of my friends have bought one after hearing it. Easy to connect to Bluetooth with my cell, and then I listen to Amazon prime music.
Sound on these is great. Sound is very balanced and not Boomy on the Bass. These are the best Headphones I have ever heard. All the in ear buds I've used have always been Fatiguing and uncomfortable after a few hours, and have awful sound quality. I have Bose Qc35 also and the P7's are better sounding and much louder than the Bose. I would recommend them to anyone looking for high quality Headphones. I used to look at people who would walk around with Over-The-Head Headsets and wonder why would anyone do this? They are super soft on the ears and block out even a crying baby 5 feet away. Anyway, if you are looking at Headphones in this price range you cannot go wrong with these in my opinion. Still listening to it everyday after a month. They are solid, feel comfortable and sound well balanced. They do tend to get hot over a period of long listening. After several try, I was able to pair my Iphone with the P7. The only thing missing is the noise cancelling.
The length of the cord is good. It also did not work with my extension cord with Usb charging port, which I also need more Usb ports. Cons: the cord is only about 2 feet long so it has to live on the PC tower as opposed to on my desk. I use it for work as I have multiple items to plug in at a time. The Usb Hub is no exception. It's heavy and solid. A quality product .. It's so nice not having to crawl under my desk for a Usb 3.0 connection. The cord was too short so I had to buy an extension in order to connect it to a Usb port on my Cpu. It's heavy enough to sit in one place on my desk. One Usb connection to my laptop now gives me a keyboard, mouse and printer. Works great! I've connected a variety of devices, including an external hard drive with no issue. This is a great little Hub.
Very noticeably speeds up loading times for gaming on my Xbox. Tons of storage now for my Xbox one. No issues at all. All Seagate though. Used for Xbox one. It ’ s just been sitting on my TV stand connected to me Xbox one X. Plug and play. So we ended up buying an external drive. Super easy to install. I have about 50 games installed on this hard drive and still have 75% of space left. Love this Ssd! Plenty of space for extra games. Stopped working after 2 years. This hard drive is awesome.
I was unimpressed with photos outdoors in sunlight as well, so I returned it and picked up the Wx350 instead. The camera is capable of taking panoramic photos, and video but not still shots. It takes clear pictures and is easy to use. Takes good Pix. The picture quality is good. Got this for a trip to Disney world. Bought this for my husband. I love this little camera! This camera is very very small. I didn't like this camera at all. Excellent camera for the price. This is my second Cyber shot. This is to replace my 10 year old sure shot. The camera takes great pictures.
Brand new!! It is easy to use and takes great pictures. Great camera for beginners. As far a pictures go you wont find anything better for less then 300 bucks. I will be investing in a longer distance lens in the future. This is my first professional camera and so far I am happy with this camera. This camera is everything I need as a non professional photographer. I love this camera. Bought this for my wife's birthday. Great camera! It takes great pictures and has lots of features for the price. The quality of the photographs is fantastic. It came fast as was well packaged.
Also, it doesn't wobble like most Headsets do. The material is attractive and the design very modern looking. Might just be a issue with my Headphones but it's something to keep in mind. You have to use both hands to pull off your Headphones or you will knock over the stand. I love this stand. It holds my Headphones. It's a clean design as far as Headphone stands go. It's a great Headphone stand and works well. It looks great. It's a Headphone stand. If I accidentally bump the stand with the Headphones on it, it tips over. It has a sleek, attractive design and functions well to hold my Headphones. Purchased two of the clear acrylic Amovee Headphone stands for my Sennseiser 598 cs and Grado Sr80E Headphones. Looks nice and is well made.
Be sure to update the Firmware before setting it up or you will have to set it up again. This is a great Wireless Router. The speed is great and so is the range. Coverage is excellent throughout the house. This is a great Router for the price. D-Link Tech support is horrible. Very good signal strength throughout the house. Also, I have not had any dropped connections or had any need to Reboot the Router. Easy to setup. Rebooting the Router helps to regain the Wireless Internet Connectivity. Works great. I purchased the D-Link Dir-655 extreme N Wireless Router to replace a Netgear Rangemax Wireless G Router that died after 13 months. For basic home networking, this Router works great. If your in the market for a Wireless Router you should really consider the D-Link Dir 655 extreme N Router.
Unfortunately I had to switch to windows 10, since Microsoft stopped supporting windows 7. I can run my Ryzen 7 1700 to 3.6 with the stock cooler. One of the best budget Am4 socket boards in my opinion. Has leds which I've never had on a Mobo before. Bought this in August to piece a system together over the course of a few months. Was able to Overclock the ram to 3000Mhz with just a few clocks and Tweaking the DRAM voltage a little. I recommend using another PC and Download the cap file directly from Asus to get the most up to date version. The fan is huge and it will block two of the memory slots! Otherwise, great board. Memory runs faster. Use the flash drive method. The picture I attached has where the PWR switch should be connected. Great Motherboard! This mother board I would only use foreign office computer it has one of the worst over clocks I have ever seen.
It scans both sides at the same time, and is very quick. Just started using this for Digitizing paper files in my office. This scanner is fast. The scanner works great if you only want a wired connection. I love this scanner! The scanning speed was much slower than was expected. I ’ M very happy with this product. The software is easy to use. I can save the document to any file I choose. I use it to Scan paper, IDS, insurance cards, and smaller pieces of paper (similar to a receipt). It is fast and easy to use. It also does Double-Sided scanning. But the actual scans it produces is so sub par in comparison. If you want to Scan multiple pages at a time (I ’ ve scanned a 100 page document flawlessly).
A minor hindrance for me was that the two halves of the keyboard move more than a one piece keyboard. My only Negative- I am left handed and all the shortcut Keys are on the left side of the keyboard. This allows my arms to rest in a much more comfortable position. This keyboard allows a more natural position of the arms. I love this keyboard! I wish the keys on this device were more like the Logitech K series, or usual laptop Keys with a smaller amount of travel. I was getting pain in my wrists and elbows. The only con is that some of the keys are slightly different from where they are placed than other Keyboards. I do Miss the number key pad a little with this set up but its worth it. The key travel is of a real keyboard, and the tactile feel is good. Get a Timer and stop every 30 min to do stretches or you will wind up with pain. I have small hands and this keyboard keeps my hands straight. I like the blue lights on the top right indicating caps lock, NUM lock and function. Best keyboard ever.
Very durable and sturdy. Plenty of room for extra controllers. This case is awesome! Carries everything I have for my switch and keeps it secure. Great case! Holds all my accessories easily and more games then almost anyone would need. I also love that it came with a shoulder strap. Fits all that I need for my switch and it's accessories. Highly recommend. Plenty of storage space for the cords and additional games as well. Solid carrying case. Everything fits. Fits the switch and everything just right. This fits everything for my switch perfectly.
Perfect Ryzen. I game with an Rx 570 8Gb and this Cpu. Upgraded from an Fx-8370 and on Cpu bound games, I'm getting nearly double the frames. So much value for the money! Installation was a breeze and it worked perfectly from the very first boot. Runs cool. Worth every dollar. Built myself a new PC to upgrade from my old hp PC I had. Runs stable at 3.9Ghz and Smashes all my games. Seriously awesome price and Gobsmacking performance. This processor is a beast. Great Cpu. Personally wish I would've gone with the 7700K or 7600K Intel processor for gaming reasons. Big upgrade from the Fx-8320 eight core processor and I'm enjoying it very much so far.
These are a very good and inexpensive pair of binoculars. These binoculars are great! They are lightweight and easy to hold. Bought these binoculars for my wife. Easy to use and focus. Great for bird watching! I bought these binoculars to leave in my deer stand. Clear view and good magnification. Easy to adjust. Easy to adjust focus and very light weight. No night vision! They are great for bird watching or what ever you need to view from a good distance. They are easy to use and the view through the lenses is crystal clear.
It kicks into Street view after you drive for 10-12Min. You can pick up a call without Torching your phone just by the Gps. Time wasted. Nice big screen. Bluetooth connection doesn ’ t work well with my Iphone. Will never buy another Tomtom. I would not recommend this model. Unfortunately they were not very good. It always finds the destination address then gives a global trip map ........ and that's it. Love this Gps. While on permanent hold, I did a Google search for Tomtom customer complaints. Not a good device to buy. I tried to contact customer support and they had me Resetting the Gps and the phone, but it didn ’ t solve the problem. We have very slow Wifi and it still Dowloaded them very quickly.
Easy to use. U can still use this to convert it to determine the needs for your pants. I can compare light output from fluorescent light to led light in Lux or Lumens or even candle power in min or Max mode. The accuracy is going to be off if you are measuring led this is for sunlight and hid Ie. This is an excellent light meter. Nice product. The Readout automatically displays the exact number. It auto ranges and the decimal point is tiny, so you have to be careful when reading, it moves to “ K ” without warning. Note: if reading led with this -2000 Lux from your reading. The meter is well designed, easy to use, and seems accurate, at least enough for my use. Going blind trying to read by lamplight? This is the first light sensor I've used, so I'm not sure if it's unique to this one, or all sensors. I suspect it is not a full spectrum detector so it won ’ t properly measure some wavelengths, like leds. It measures the intensity of light.
I purchased it so I can take portrait, Close-Ups and Low-Light but it performs miserably in these categories. It is small and relatively light, although it can be a bit awkward to carry around. Replaces a canon S100 and like the Sony better. The ability to have a fast 1.8 aperture on the wide end is huge the basic modes and manual control is a must for me. This is a great compact camera for the money. Works well in low light. Wish I had access to the camera menu from the Ipad. Absolutely love this camera. I would not recommend this camera. It's a great camera, I like it a lot. It is a fantastic little camera that is super portable, yet it takes really nice and quality photos. It takes decent photos but it's not worth the price tag. I've only had it a few days and have only taken a few pictures and I very much like the way it works. Get a screen protector, and check out he Vivitar compatible batteries.
Great radio for the price! I am so pleased with this radio. Easy to program using "Chirp" software. Battery life is good. Love this little radio. Great little radio ... I am happy with this radio. But, if you want to use it as a two-way radio, you must get a ham radio license. Listening to the repeater though I get very good reception and clarity. I live in Loveland, Co and I can hit a repeater down near boulder, about 30 miles away. Great radio. Caveat: I'm new to ham radio, and this is my first HT. The radio works great.
All of my games are loaded to this drive. I'm very disappointed. Nothing, it did not read or recognize this hard drive. I got this hard drive for my Xbox last year, and it has been working great. For the money, this drive is affordable and the amount of storage is great. Never again Seagate. Bought for my Xbox one. I made two partitions on it, one 512Gb to use with my Macbook's time machine backup, and one 1.5Tb partition to use as general storage. Plug and play. I've had it for less than 6 months and the drive has failed. Plugged into the Usb 3.0 slot on my box--very satisfied with the performance. This is a great little drive. Lots of space. This hard drive never worked.
They are great ear buds! I love these earphones. The noise cancellation is useless. They are very comfortable around my ears and they never fall off. The battery life is great. Love these for my phone calls. They stay on my ears and sound great. The left ear was scratching and the right ear was not working. After a week in a half, the left ear piece stopped working. Sometimes one Earbud doesn ’ t seat correctly in the case so it doesn ’ t charge. Sound is great and connected to my Iphone right away. The sound is muted, no Bass and Guite poor. The sound quality is great. They are comfortable on my ears and easy to use.
However the aperture ring on this lens is too lose and easily moved by my left supporting hand. The Xtran sensor puts out great Jpg from the camera and the continued Firmware upgrades absolutely sell the camera. Looking forward to shooting with some of the fast prime glass. Great build. Accurate color. I love this camera. I have the X100S and the Nikon D600. This is my first Semi-Professional camera. However the Low-Light performance and light weight make it ideal for travel, scenic, weddings and excursions into dimly lit music Venues. This is a wonderful design, as I have been shooting since the 60's and relate to manual control of major functions. If I had to choose one camera for travel photography, this camera with the 18-135Mm lens would be that camera. Great camera. Directional buttons are too soft as is commonly known. It is now Oct. 15 and I am still a great fan of this camera.
We found an Downloadable update on the Vizio Website copied to a Usb and updated the TV ourselves. The picture quality is great. Great TV for the price. The picture is beautiful but the TV turns itself on by itself. All the reviews were great and then we hooked it up. First clue was Tnf between the cowboys and bears and I thought maybe a fog rolled in. Vizio got a repair man to install a new board, but the TV continued to turn itself on independently. First 4K smart TV ever. Great picture and Specs. I have strong Wifi connection but the moment the TV tries to stream anything in 4K from the built in Apps it will lock up. The Hdr is good enough to improve viewing and the control is snappy and responsive. Now coming to the TV, I'm amazed by the picture quality that you get out of this considering its price! Takes forever to power on. Love this TV.
The weather resistance qualities make using it in damp to wet conditions an anxiety free proposition. Those lenses fit and work perfectly with the Digital camera. The camera takes great pictures on auto or scene mode, so you can start getting great shots right out of the box. The Pentax K-50 was my first foray into dslr photography. Very pleased with this camera. This is my fourth Pentax Slr or dslr camera and I stay with the brand because I have several good lenses that are compatible. I cant wait to learn more about it and have fun! Thumb up! Delivery was prompt and item was as advertised. Other than that, love the weight and feel of this camera in my hands. I Tweaked some of my photos in Adobe Lightroom before posting them here. Weather protection, great image quality, flexible settings and excellent optical Viewfinder are the main positives for me. Love this camera. Great camera!
Best Router I ever had. I've switched back to my older Asus Router and I've boxed this one back up. Problem is with the device itself after the Firmware update. This Router is amazing. Speed is good (I get a bit more than the 300M I'm paying my Isp for). I can't keep an Internet connection and the Wi-Fi keeps dropping out. So far I have not experienced any dropped connections. Great Router! Easy to setup. Now the signal is week. With the Xfinity Modem/Router rental, I was lucky to get 140Mbps. Our Wi-Fi is down more than it is up. I'd buy it again. Blocking late night access was possible (this Router, and previous one) but only by the hour.
The canvas is thick and sturdy and the leather straps are clearly real leather. Great bag! This bag is amazing! The shoulder pad rests in the front of me instead of my shoulder. Durable, heavy duty material. Fits my hp 15.6 inch laptop with room to spare. The shoulder strap is really comfortable. Nice material and construction. Plenty of room! Highly recommend. Other than that good quality bag. It's very sturdy and functional. Fits my Macbook pro 15". Lots of pockets.
I bought two of these along with the center Speaker to replace my old Onkyo speakers. Highly recommended. Highs and Mids are very good, and the Bass is terrific. Great sound. These sound amazing! Great Speaker for the price. I bought these speakers at 30% discount. It gave a little more life to my aging sound system that will get replaced later this year. Well after receiving them and installing them I was blown away by the sound quality. Great sound for the price. Love these speakers. They sound pretty good for inexpensive speakers. These speakers are great for a small space. They sound great and even look cool.
Super fast start up. Other then this this laptop is OK no issue. Touchscreen perfect and clear. Amazon seller wasn't much help so had to send it back to hp. If am singing up for something and creating accounts it just suddenly appears this blue screen and shuts the hell down. - battery life is horrible. I am shocked at how fast this laptop starts up and shuts down! Battery lasts 3 times longer than her old laptop! Very fast. - fan is loud and hot and almost always on. I usually purchase hp laptops. A good laptop for the price! Fast, lightweight and everything I was looking for!
Step 1. Love this power strip! Very nice to be downstairs and be able to Preheat the bed upstairs. 2 stars because I love that you can control each outlet and Usb separately (I use the Google home). But as a smart device and trying to connect it to Alexa? It works great. You can name each plug to turn off what you would like to. I bought a white one with another link that works good but goes Offline once in a while. But if you are sticking to everyday lights and thing alike, this would be great. After moving, I cannot get it to connect to the Wifi. So I was looking at getting rid of the mechanical timers on my 55G planted Aquarium. While it did shut down without destroying anything plugged into it, it does not have a breaker reset button. Easy to set up and use ..... works well with Google!!! Very easy to set and the App easily guides you through connecting the power strip to the Internet.
Comes with Hdmi Cable. I use it as a monitor for my computer. Using it as a computer monitor. We love this TV. At 4K resolution refresh rate is at 30Hz. Therefore, I concluded it was a result of the Video card outdated software. Great picture. Two months after purchasing this monitor, it developed a red line of Pixels vertically down the screen. Overall, a great buy. S * * * Ty image quality, awful sound and has no options for external Audio. The speakers are also terrible as others have said. I really like this TV. Television arrived with dead Pixels. Great as a computer monitor.
It has two extra spots for hard drives too, one of them being attached to the Dvd optical drive though. They did the smart thing and went for a higher speed hard drive. I'm not a Gamer, nor do I use my computer for business. For basic web browsing and Email it should do fine. It has been an excellent computer and there have been no problems in the first several months. Windows 10. I use this PC for a small home business. Nice PC for a very good price. Like the two Hdmi ports. Restart is incredibly fast. It really can't run origin games. Used my Microsoft account to get started, went back, created Offile account, deleted the account I was forced to start with. I bought it because Amazon had a special Pay-Per-Month special. Tried to return it again on Amazon.
Great printer. It prints great. Very happy with this printer. The printer works great. I love this printer. Fast Printing and love two sided printing. This is the best printer I've ever owned. Print quality is very good. The only negative about this printer is the high cost of ink cartridges. Prints great, but eats the ink. It prints fast and seems pretty ink efficient too. Love the Wireless print feature. Awesome printer! I would recommend this printer.
This is a great add-on peripheral for slim notebooks with no built in CD drive. Love this external drive! Works great with a Mac. The Z40 doesn't have a CD-ROM drive. If you have a Macbook, buy this instead of the official apple external drive. Plug and play. Is reliable and works perfect. Note: it does require a Usb port on your device. I received it quickly in the mail and plugged it into my Macbook pro. For the money, it's a very good drive. Got this because I live in Europe, and wanted to have a Dvd Player for us Dvds. I use it to read and burn CD. Highly recommend! It works with music CDs, Cdr and Dvd Rw.
Really excellent Cable Modem and Router combination. I bough this Modem/Router to replace the one from my Internet provider. I have great coverage throughout the house and have constant speeds. The Wifi signal is strong and it stays connected, but it drops the Internet more than a dozen times a day. And now my speed is actually the speed I pay for. The signal is great. Easy to install. Perfect for my 1,000 sq ft apartment. No more monthly rental fees from your Internet provider! The Wifi is a tad better than the Comcast supplied Modem-Router. The Netgeer Nighthawk AC 1900 (C7000V2) is one of the best Modem/Router Combos out there. I had a problem with maintaining a connection to the Internet. The Tech support was excellent. Do not buy this!!!!!
Volume goes far with good Bass and clear sound. Led to believe it was great sound value for money, for those on a budget, which is me. Great sound. Surprisingly loud for a small Bluetooth Speaker. Keep the "Bass" option on as it makes everything sound a lot better. The sound quality is fantastic. This is greate Speaker. But battery life seems to be pretty good. Great Speaker pros. The sound quality is very good. I love these speakers. Great sound for it's size. Great sound for such a small device. Awesome Bluetooth Speaker!
My living room has never sounded better. The back panel is Scorching hot, so it is now Unplugged, as I was afraid it might be a hazard. The Polk sounded amazing right out of the box. I needed something small for a bedroom placement, and this fits the bill. I am in the Audio biz and this sub is amazing for the price. No distortion, clean, tight Bass. We were space constrained and this is what would fit in the space we had. I have a small room with some small bookshelf speakers. Simply put, this little guy kicks butt. This Subwoofer is a seriously great Subwoofer ... Great sound for the price! Great little sub for my PC. The volume control helps give a little more punch. But for this application it really made a huge difference.
Love this set. They heat evenly and are easy to clean. My first set of stainless steel Cookware. Nice and heavy pots and pans. Everything sticks. Good heat distribution. I love these pots and pans! Love this Cookware. The pots and pans are amazing. So I only use Non-Stick pan for eggs. I love these pans! It's a beautiful set. Be mindful that these are not Non-Stick. The rims on these pots and pans are so sharp.
I used it on both bare floor and rugs. After 4 months of light usage the battery no longer charges. The battery and battery charger will not work. The suction power is great. Picks up cat hair easily. I love this vacuum. And the battery lasts for what I need. I can tell by how much dirt it Sucks up by what needs to be emptied from the container, which is very easy to empty. It is so nice to not have a cord to fight with. This is a great little vacuum. The battery is easy to install and remove. I love this Cordless vacuum cleaner. The battery is fully charged. Waste of money.
George foreman grill who? I love it for making grilled sandwiches; the floating hinge lid means one side of the sandwich does not get squashed. Love this little grill. We use it for beef Burgers, Vegi Burgers, Turkey Burgers, chicken breasts, Paninis, Grilled-Cheese, and Pancakes. I love this Griddler! Also got the waffle plates for it. The removable plates are great and simple for clean up! Cooked Pancakes and the Griddler does not get up to correct temps. Easy to clean. Having the temperature control is excellent. Obviously, an outdoor grill is always better - but this is a close second. I love this grill! Easy to clean with the removable plates. Very versatile.
Heats up quickly, easy to clean and store. I use it to make grilled cheese and Turkey sandwiches. I love this Panini maker! So far so good. Great little Panini press. Heats up fast. It cooks evenly. Heats up and Toasts the bread quickly. It holds at least 2 sandwiches and sometimes 3 depending on the bread size. Easy to clean. Great press. It is nice grill. Love this Panini press! It has no temperature control.
Easy to install. Toothbrushes are protected from Splatter and Toothpastes can be kept organized. Our son loves it. Saves counter space and holds a good amount of stuff. It ’ s as described. Helps maintain hygiene with Toothbrushes and water cups. If you are a big FA! Ily this is a must have. I attached it to my mirror because my tiny bathroom left few other options. Spacious to keep the electric tooth brushes. We have three young kids and Toothbrushes all over the place we're getting to be a mess. I thought the adhesive back wouldn't stick on the wall but it did! I did holes 2-3 inches apart similar to the holes you see in the 2ND picture I added. Cute colorful set that hangs in the bathroom and keeps our toothpaste and brushes clean and organized. Have had it in the shower for about a month now with no issues.
It works well. Would be five stars except it is loud on Micro function. When you try to get the food out, it comes slipping out and I've been burned several times. I did enjoy the grill feature. The Microwave still was working well. Would shut off. As you can see from the picture, I sadly decided to return mine and not burn the house down. I haven ’ t tried the baking feature yet. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase. Moves on a whim. The power button stopped working. Oven does Cook well. Big and fast at heating all sorts of things. Great Microwave oven.
The set is pretty on the stove. Yhe heat distribution is marvelous and my food has been cooking better and more even. I ’ M an avid cook, and decided to try these out even though some had said the copper color comes off. Set is beautiful, easy to clean if you use a powder detergent (powder Ajax or so) to erase white dots remaining after cooking. Definitely not a non stick product. The bronze color and grain is beautiful, the food cooked taste also good. Once understood, it's a lovely addition to my kitchen. I love these pots and pans. Most beautiful pots and pans I have ever owned. I love these pans. Also the food that I cooked stuck to the pan during the first use. Very Heavyweight and beautiful. Absolutely beautiful set! The issues started as soon as we Unboxed these pans.
I love the freezer. At least the freezer keeps things frozen. It comes with a mini ice cube tray and it ’ s adorable. This is a great little Fridge. So far so good. Great Fridge! Very quiet. This is a great refrigerator. And it's not noisy. I find this Fridge to be perfect for my needs. Can hold a gallon of milk and a few other things. It came with a little dent on the front Definably not a big deal. Good Fridge, cools nicely. The freezer is perfect.
I washed it before putting it on the Mattress, it held up well for the wash and dry. I recently bought a new Mattress and got the Luna premium Hypoallergenic Mattress protector prior to the Mattress delivery. This is the best Mattress cover. Arrived on time. Made in the USA. It fits the Mattress, and the top is covered. It is soft and comfortable as well. The Mattress protector is not noisy and does not make the bed hot. This Mattress protector fits my new queen size Mattress perfectly. My collie Vomitted on the bed and the protector stopped the liquid from getting to the Mattress. It is completely waterproof!! It doesn't make any noise and it's soft and playable. Easy to wash and dry. I love this Mattress protector!
Very sturdy and look more expensive than they are. Great shelves. Easy to assemble. I love this book shelf. However, one of the shelves is broken. Love this bookcase! It is beautiful! I was very happy with the table, it seems sturdy and it worked great in my studio. Solid shelf that looks nice at a great price. I love the rustic look of it. I love this desk!!! Easy to put together. Seems to be real wood and sturdy. For the price you can ’ t get a better Deal- I searched Overstock and Wayfair and this was a great deal.
He said it ’ s like sleeping on a cloud. I love my Casper Mattress. This is the best Mattress I have ever used. Love this Mattress. Husbands a back Sleeper I ’ M a side Sleeper. I wake up with less back pain in the mornings than I'd been used to from sleeping on spring mattresses. I like a firm Mattress, but it's a little too firm. It ’ s so comfortable, I have gotten much better nights of sleep and fallen asleep much faster since I got it. I have to say this bed has given me the best sleep of my life! I'd choose it any day over a box spring Mattress. Best bed I've ever slept on. No more back pain in the morning. Not too soft, not too firm. It is extremely comfortable.
The fryer was very easy to clean and the oil Saver was fabulous. This is not a cheaply made deep fryer. This is the best fryer we have ever had. The oil drain system is excellent! Love the oil storage container. I guess that ’ s the trade off for having the oil storage container. Works very well. If you don't own a deep fryer get this one. I love that it is Dishwasher safe! Now I'm in the market for a new fryer, to replace this one. Easy to clean. My one complaint is the temperature control. We have cooked everything from fried chicken, wings, vegetable Tempura, French Fries~Both Idaho and sweet potato! I love this deep fryer.
Love this Panini Press/Grill. It's a black Friday's surprise. So it doesn't take up much counter space. The Non-Stick surface is great. We've had the Breville Panini press for over a year now and it's a great little appliance. Love this Panini maker!!!!! I use it mainly to make grilled cheese sandwiches. An excellent device!! Just wipe with a paper towel. I love this Breville Panini press! It's so easy--and the sandwiches are so good. Heats up fast and Grills the Paninis flawlessly. This press Toasts bread easily. It HEATS quickly, HEATS evenly and the hinged lid works perfectly.
I love this bed frame. No Squeaks. Love the extra storage under the frame. Easy to assemble. Very sturdy. Lots of space underneath for storage. So far, so good! I love this frame!!! However, do not plan on using this product with a Box-Spring. This frame is very sturdy. Easy to put together. We used it for a memory foam Mattress. This bed frame is amazing. Holds my Mattress comfortably without a box spring.
Looks great on my Countertop. I have only had mine for 2 months but I am very happy with it. The Carafe is cheap and does not keep the coffee hot. The coffee taste good but I'm not at all happy with the Carafe! The Carafe keeps the coffee hot for few hours. It is easy to use and the coffee tastes fantastic if you use a good coffee and good water. The coffee Brews quickly and delivers the very hot water needed to extract the best from the grounds. We bought this very expensive coffee maker because it was rated #1 by cooks illustrated. Makes great coffee and it's easy to use. This is our second Moccamaster. The coffee stays hot until I finish the pot. Great coffee maker. I bought the thermos style thinking it would keep coffee warm but the coffee is never hot enough to begin with. Easy to use and clean and makes the best cup of coffee ever.
This little iron is powerful for its size. Nice long cord. I use it for Quilting. Gets hot quick. I love this little iron! I use it for my sewing projects. Very compact. Bought it to use for ironing Quilt blocks. I use it next to my sewing machine while doing patchwork Quilting. Excellent for my sewing projects! It HEATS up quickly. This little iron holds its own with a lot of heat for such a small iron. Perfect for travel. This little iron is perfect!
Love this Crock * pot .. This is my first Crock-Pot brand slow Cooker. This is a great slow Cooker. I ’ ve cooked in it twice a week or more since I got it. Very nice slow Cooker. I love the Timer feature! Love the locks on the lid for transporting food. The outside gets so hot. I love this Crock pot. I love the locking lid. It cooks great. There are three settings high low and warm. This Crockpot is awesome! Terrific Crock pot.
I would not go back to a turn table style Microwave again. It heat the food evenly and very convenient to use. Well, these don't seem to be much better. My favorite feature is the "smart" buttons. They are smart buttons in that you can program them to do things other than Whats on the Keypad. Not commercial grade or strong enough. The bells sounded, same result, the food had not been heated. This was installed in an office building and people are hard to train. Great Microwave for high traffic. I like the fact you don't have a revolving dish. Bought this for my mother, easy for her to use and only cooks 6 min. I chose to turn it off. Powerful and compact. I love this Microwave.
Works great on my Handscraped, hardwood floors. This vacuum is not made for carpet, but works well on any hard flat surface. Lightweight and easy to maneuver. There are three areas that trap dirt and need to be cleaned in order to empty the vacuum. We bought this little vacuum for our new hardwood floors, and it's the best thing ever. My only complaint is the cord is pretty short. I love this vacuum!! This vacuum is amazing. Love this little vacuum. The suction is great! It picks up pet hair and dirt as advertised. And it picks up dust!! I have 4 cats and 2 dogs.
Thanks Oxo for another great product. I then had to use a knife to get the pit out of the mechanism. Works great, sometimes the pit gets stuck in the tool. Used it for Pitting cherries for a Cherry crumble. The Pitter works great on cherries and olives. This is supposed to keep the Cherry juice off your hands. I love this Cherry Pitter. Love this gadget. Very little mess, easy to clean, and to use. Easy to clean. I used to have to cut the pits out of Cherrys for my son. This Cherry Pitter was not useful. This is a great tool. I love cherries and it makes it so much easier!
I just had a total knee surgery and needed to raise the couch to make it easier to get up from sitting. I used the bed Risers to raise my couch. Slight overkill, I suppose. If you have a King bed, you need six of these not four!! Very strong! The height was excellent, but the raisers did not stay put on their hardwood floors. Just the right height to raise my chair. I like the height. Worked perfectly. This is a large antique solid wood desk. After falling over twice I removed to find one (of four) had just about collapsed & failed. I bought these because I have casters on my frame and regular Risers didn't have a big enough opening. I purchased these in two sizes, one for my sofa and the other for my dining room table. Was thinking of ways to increase my table height as my chair would get obstructed.
Produces 14 oz of coffee. Makes a wonderful single cup of coffee .. and fast. Thanks Hamilton Beach! No K-Cups. Makes hot coffee in less than 3 minutes. I switched from a French press. I love this coffee maker. This one makes the coffee taste like burnt plastic. Easy to clean. Even using the "bold" setting. Easy to use, easy to clean and makes a great cup of coffee!! Great little coffee machine. Small enough that it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. If you like strong coffee this is not the coffee maker for you.
Perfectly cooked rice Everytime. If you use less water, the rice comes out burned on the bottom. I loved this rice Cooker. The steaming works well though, and being able to make the rice and keep it warm for hours is great. Comes with measuring cup and measurements in the pan. It cooks rice perfectly! Bought this to replace an older rice Cooker and it is fantastic! The slow Cooker is excellent. I really love this rice Cooker steamer. This is not just a rice Cooker! Rice comes out perfect every time. Easy to clean. Just add the rice and water per the instructions, choose white or Brown rice and wait. This is the best rice maker I have ever owned.
Love the broom rake to get hair off the bristles. The Dustpan works great, easy to get the dirt into and easy to empty. I love this Sweeper set! The rubber lip of the pan is flush with the floor and the teeth clean out the bristles perfectly. The only negative is that the bristles on the brush have quite easily bent. I like the teeth on the dust pan to pull out dust and hair that gets stuck in the broom bristles. I love the dust pan, but the broom leaves much to be desired. The only caution is to be sure to place the broom straight into the Dustpan. I love this set. Not sure why I would collapse the broom handle. I like it. I love the Dustpan, but the broom does not function. The dust pan doesn't lay flush to the Floor.Dust and debris you're hoping to brush into the pan goes underneath. Love this broom and Dustpan!
I washed it before putting it on the bed. I love this Mattress cover! It washes well!! Very comfortable. Very happy with this Mattress pad. The fabric is so soft and it drapes nicely. It fits great. Stays in place. Good cover. It fits my queen size Mattress perfect. It fits perfectly! The pad was as advertised. They fit perfectly and don't bunch up. Well made.
I poured in ingredients for hot cider and it worked great. I got it for our schools open Mic night. This was remedied by bringing the brew station towards the edge of the table so the cup could fit in the space. The coffee maker makes a good tasting cup of coffee with reasonable speed. The Styrofoam cups Crumple when you try to use them - scalding hands. Leaked the first time I used it. The trouble is that the paper cups we use at church are not tough enough to push the dispenser button without bending the cup. Order to replace the old burned out coffee pot. Great coffee maker. Great for large groups or office. We drink so much coffee in a days time, that a 10 or 12 cup Coffeemaker did not suffice. It keeps coffee hot for hours. Purchased this for my Sunday school class. You push against a button to dispense liquid.
This is a beautiful piece of furniture. Very easy to put together. It was easy to put together and seems to be good quality. Great piece. Looks great in our Entryway! The two side doors fit perfectly but the four drawers in the middle don't sit straight. I love this piece. The piece of furniture looks like the picture and matches great to the wood in my dining. I needed a storage or accent cabinet to make a shabby chic coffee and tea station. Very easy to assemble. It came mostly assembled only requiring the legs and bottom shelf to be attached. 12 screws, 12 washers and an Allen wrench all included. Beautiful color. It took me about 15 minutes once it was out of the box.
My only complaint is that even on its lowest setting, it's a wind tunnel. The fan arrived and was easy to assemble. Love this fan! Do not buy this fan. Nice fan. Pros: it puts out lots of air, easy to assemble no bolts etc. Great fans! Easy to assemble. The fan works. It sounds like a fan. This fan is very loud! Very powerful fan! The cover of the fan is cheap plastic and it bumped the front falls off. This fan is a real performer.
Very quiet, and easy to empty the water reservoir when they get full. I used it in my camper during a rain period and it has worked surprisingly well. Very quiet. Product is small, so it's only good for a very small space. Also helps with the air conditioning. It is very humid here on the Texas coast line and it is doing it's job. This is a great little Dehumidifier. It does take water out of the air. I have not used it in my trailer yet, but have tested it in my home. Very quiet and efficient. We purchased this for a basement bathroom with no windows and one small exhaust fan. Easy to empty. I have a large Dehumidifier but it's noisy, so I mostly run that when not immediately next to it. I have it in a small bathroom.
Cubes are easy to pop out!!! Makes ridiculously tiny ice cubes which melt very fast. Not only do the lids help to keep "stuff" out of the water as it is freezing, but it also makes it easier to stack. They have lids so you can stack them before they're frozen. I love these ice trays. Best ever ice cube trays. Its definitely not air tight. They are slightly smaller than regular ice cubes, so I need to use more of them, but otherwise, what a great invention. So easy to pop the ice out! You can't "crack" them like normal ice trays to release the ice. I love that these have lids! I love how easy it is to pop the cubes out of the tray once frozen. This thin plastic will break in half with the slightest twist. I don't see a difference so why not go with a cheaper product that produces the same results.
Love that it is Non-Stick, too! If you like the edges, you will love this pan. I love this pan! Love this pan, makes the best Brownies. I just love this edge baking pan! This is the best Brownie pan ever. The Brownies have 3 Chewy sides. The edges (every. The Brownies turn out perfectly every single time and they practically slip out of the pan with a rubber Spatula. Love this Brownie pan! It ’ s all about the edges. The Brownies cooked evenly and were so easy to cut (Spatula included) and remove. Heavy duty construction. This pan is awesome!
Fits perfectly in my half sheet baking pan! Great baking rack. Cookie sheet sits on it good. Fits perfectly in half sheet pan. Great Baking/Cooling rack. The spring chef 10" X15" cooling & baking rack is awesome! Fits Nordicware half sheet pan perfectly. I will also use it in the oven to Bake bacon. Love my cooling racks! Very sturdy rack. We needed a 17" cooling rack for cooking bacon in the oven. I love that it ’ s stainless steel. Very well made! I love this rack!!
This is an beautiful Teapot, but I did not like it since the base was so small, about 4". Only complaint is that it doesn't whistle, so I sometimes forget and find myself distracted. Used it once a day for tea. I love it. Love this kettle! It boils up clean, and perfect tasting water. Comes with metallic ring for electric stoves. This is a cute little kettle that looks pretty and clean, and is easy to clean. This has a glass lid. Love that you can see the bubbles so you don't have to completely boil the water for tea. I actually got this glass water kettle for health reasons. I liked the all glass design of this kettle so much. Very pleased with this tea pot. Never used it on high (gas stove).
Took us about 2 hours to put together. My daughter loves this bed! This is a great bunk bed. The kids love it. We were able to fit a queen bed underneath with room on one side for a stand up fan. Bed is also a bit wobbly. Purchased this for my 12 year old son. Great bed for the price. The bed is easy to assemble. The instructions were easy to follow. Assembled by one person. Love this bed! The bars for the ladder are a little thin, so could hurt the feet, but my daughter has no problems.
Love this coffee maker. As many other customer reviews state, the reservoir from the single serve side leaks water all over the counter, every day. I love this coffee machine. The Carafe keeps coffee warm for hours. The coffee pot function works great. The coffee is hot. The coffee maker looks great in my kitchen, and the the 12-Cup brewing feature works fine. It makes great coffee. The coffee pot side works very well. The coffee maker side does not keep the coffee hot after it has brewed. Makes a mess on counter. This coffee machine is good. I was wrong. Makes a great cup of coffee.
My herbs are drying well. Soon we wil have dried fruit and fruit leather Galore. Dries evenly and consistently. I love the temperature control and the Timer. I have dried fruits, vegetables and meats. I love this Dehydrator. I've used it many times to make jerky and fruit leathers. I absolutely love this Dehydrator. I have made jerky a few times in it. Only complaint is that it is a bit loud but the quality of the product makes up for it 100X. Love the Timer! This is the best Dehydrator on the market! While you can hear the unit when operating, it is quiet compared to other Dehydrators I've had. So far, I've used it to make beef jerky and chicken treats for my dogs.
Room was cooled to 17C within minutes of operating. It is worth the noise if you need the cooling. And also with the fan function there's no oscillation so if you are not sat directly in line with it it doesn't help much. However, I needed to buy an extension hose to move the unit further indoors. It is noisy, there is not denying that. Cools my bedroom really well. It worked really well, even just using the dry mode, it can lower the temperature 2-3 degrees easily. Makes a large room cold in no time. It can get so hot in our house, especially because we can ’ t open our windows since we have strictly indoor cats. The fan didn't slow down if if the required temperature was met. They had excellent after sales care and resolved the situation for us. It completely cools down the bedroom and small landing and that is it. I am now able to sleep better cause of inventor and them hot sticky nights are just a memory.
Easy to use. This Stuffer worked extremely well and was easy to control. Because you will be using salt be sure to clean the machine after use. You can run it at its lowest speed or turn it the whole way up and it has no trouble with the Driest meats. It came with 3 Stuffer tubes, but none were small enough for snack stick. Called Lem and they are a 9 to 5, M through f business. The hopper is huge so you do not have to stuff the meat in there as much. Sausage Stuffer "excellent"! Starting using Preground pork from a local Butcher which saves a lot of work and today used the new Lem 1606. The clamps made one man operation a breeze! Lift vertical threaded rod while Retracting with drill or gears will grind. Love this Stuffer! Nice Stuffer. Have done 5 batches of sausage - about 20 to 25 pounds of meet each.
It restores the shine on a good surface. Beautiful very noticeable shine and gleam to the floor, and very easy to use. I lifted carpet that had been Covering68 year old Oak floors. Can find the spray cleaner at Walmart but not the floor restorer. My 60 year old wood floors look brand new! My circa 1908 home has beautiful Oak tongue in groove flooring. My floors look fabulous!! I was happy with the results of using this product. Easy to apply. Makes my wood floors look so beautiful. It is not sticky, gives a great shine, and fills in scratches very well. If shiny is what the result needs to be, this is it .. The hardest part of the whole process was keeping the dog and family out of there while it dried! I am now stuck having to work in Smalls batches scrubbing on my hands and knees to remove it.
Easy to fill, easy to use, easy to adjust the coarseness of the grind. Easy to Refill. The best salt and pepper shakers! These are wonderful salt and pepper grinders. Grinds easily and easy to use. Could not ask for more in a salt and pepper grinder set! I love these salt and pepper mills. These are great grinders. Love these salt and pepper shakers! I love these grinders. I expected more out of $40 salt and pepper grinders. They are the best grinders I have ever used. Love these. Oxo has perfected the salt and pepper grinder set.
The shelves are pressed wood and the poles are plastic. I wouldn't put anything too heavy on it. It took me all of 5 minutes to assemble. You get a great little corner shelf for a good price. I love it. Easy to assemble. No tools needed. I love this corner shelf. I love this in the corner of my living room! It was easy to assemble no tools required. This is a great shelf. But it ’ s very cheaply made. The shelves are particle board but solid and the poles are plastic but also sturdy. Super cute and easy to put together.
This is a very clean looking wine Decanter. The wine Decanter is shown with a stainless steel aerator. Prefect for my wine events! Love this Decanter. Simple design but elegant as well. False picture!!!!! I love the shape and design of this Decanter. This only includes the Decanter base (only 1 thing included). Love it. Great Decanter for the price. Makes wine taste better than ever. It's got a beautiful shape and I use it for every bottle of red I open. Sometimes wine goes everywhere. Both recipients loved it.
We bought a King size for our Rv. Very firm. We have been sleeping on this for a week now and we are more rested with less back pain. This Mattress is perfect. Very comfortable. Great Mattress for the price. I love the pillows too. This bed is amazing! This is the second Dynastymattress cool breeze we've purchased. I have been sleeping on this Mattress for about 1 year now. Mattress helped my back and keeps me cool, but ever since the first night we slept on the Mattress I have had neck problems. The Mattress came vacuum packed, amazing! It Doesnt get hot, its firm, but not too firm. I love this Mattress!
It will quickly remove wrinkles from new, heavy drapes. I really like this iron. I've used Rowenta irons for years and this one scared me last night. It leaks water. I love this iron! Lots of steam. The steam is amazing! It stopped working yesterday. ! ” I ’ ve had my iron 16 months and the last two months have been trying. I like this iron. The steam is great! After using this Rowenta, I was surprised at the amount of steam it put out. Built cheaply compared to the previous irons from Rowenta. It leaks.
I use these in our pantry and they do just what they're supposed to--save space and help you stay organized. Also, it ’ s pretty flimsy. Love this to organize my pantry better. Will not fit larger diameter and length cans, such as large Veg-All, Family-Size Campbell ’ s soup and Campbell ’ s chunky soup cans. The item shipped only holds 30 normal sized cans and 10 Tuna sized cans. Will be being at least one additional unit. Easy to assemble. This is a great product if you just want to use it with regular sized cans. It also keeps the cans in order for their use. This might be helpful if you want to store a “ different ” type of canned good in the middle. They are sturdy enough to place a basket on top of to maximize my food storage and organization. I will be buying another. It ’ s very sturdy, it goes together pretty easy, and it holds the cans and distributes them nicely. It holds a ton of cans.
I've used many of the pots for cooking, and so far have done well, the food doesn't stick to the pots. The Non-Stick coating chips off sauce pans in big chips. The pots and pans are great. Nice set of pots and pans! The non stick works. My mom needed to replace some of her older pots and pans and this was perfect. This set is a great starter set. Love this set! I love these pots and pans! The utensils are fine, as are the Frying pans. I love these pans. Amazing deal! Ive been using it almost 5 months and it Doesnt make food to stick to it.
Love this Spiralizer! I love it. Lots of fun creating new dishes. I've used it for Zucchini, sweet potatoes and broccoli stems. Love this Spiralizer. Easy to use and clean. I look forward to trying many new recipes with various appropriate produce. Blades are sharp and cut well. This Spiralizer is so easy to use! This is so much fun to use. Can't wait to try it. What a great way to eat more Veggies. This is my first Spiralizer. The suction cup on the bottom is the best!
I was heart broken when my final piece of Stemware 'Went to heaven' being washed. So far so good. Like always put liquid in the glasses then ice. * edit * ran the remaining glass through the Dishwasher. Looks nice, but is quite fragile. They are elegant, they keep beverage cold longer than other wine glasses. They break easily. These glasses keep the beverage cold and look Classy. Since then (1 month) one of the glasses broke in the sink with no apparent reason as there was no other things in the sink. Probably would still have remained ice cold much longer, but I finished the beer. Keep white wines cold. These glasses are beautiful! Love these glasses. These wine glasses are perfect!
It ’ s big and it ’ s heavy, but it doesn ’ t hold up well to serious chopping like it says. My wife loves this cutting board. I oiled it for him too with some mineral oil. Nice cutting boards. They could use a good rounding over. 3+ years of daily use. They are thick and solid, but not too heavy, and they provide a very nice cutting surface. Overall, despite the somewhat rough finish, it seems like a nice product. This board is a beautiful and functional addition to my new kitchen! I have washed it and oiled it. I am very pleased with the sizes and I love the thickness of them. It is a beautiful Butcher block that I gave as a gift to a family member who absolutely loved it. It is exactly what it says it is "thick heavy & solid". I can ’ t risk having chopping board pieces in my food.
Our set came with 1.5 Qt and 4 Qt pans, which are often a little small and a little large for cooking for two people. I also loved that it was made in the USA. We own a set of All-Clad copper core Cookware but decided this size pan would be handy to add to our collection. I have a collection of the All-Clad copper core Cookware and it never Disappoints. It's a good pot. This Cookware is nothing I ever owned before. But good quality Cookware, if you need this size. All-Clad is now my "go to.". Be careful and only buy all clad that is sold by Amazon. Cooks evenly and cleans up easily. However, the quality and construction is top notch and it is excellent for it's intended purpose otherwise. This is a wonderful pan. The 1.5 sauce pan is excellent.
I used the Danner Website to approximate the size I would need and it is spot on. I love my Danner boots! These boots fit great! Received promptly, but very very narrow. Many reviewers were saying these boots ran big while many others said to order your regular size. They do take awhile to break in so give yourself time to do it before you're trip. I plan on many years of hiking! I love these boots! They are my favorite boots!! Odd SIZING, great boot! I ordered a size 6 and they fit perfect. The boots are beautiful. Ordered a half size down, since that's what the Danner Website suggested. I have pretty Normal/Narrow feet but I had to exchange for a 9.5 because I knew my toes would be Cramped.
Now that's out of the way, I like the design and the comfort of these Filas. A gift to a male. Very nice looking shoes, no doubt. I own many high end stylish shoes but these are special the remind me of the 90S in a special way. I was impressed with the quality of the leather and the support offered. It's really small but if I was to step in the light someone might see it. Old school Fila bringing new school flair. The red color was too bright for me. I bought these to use as a light-weight Motorcycle boot. The ankle strap on the shoe gives me extra ankle support and the inside is very Cushy. You will need to insert your favorite Insoles in these sneaks. The shoes had glue on the top, both the right & left shoe (s). Yankee blue is my favorite. Overall four out of five Star shoe.
Got the for my mom and she is in love with them. I am on my feet at school for 6Hrs and these slip on and off so easily and are extremely comfortable. Also my foot slips out if the back when I walk. I went out and bought some arch supports, first, to put in these shoes. I love Sketchers shoes, it ’ s all I buy. It really is Comfy. I work 12H shifts and have bone spurs on my heel. I ’ m going to try another half size bigger, a size 7. Easy to slip on and off. Loved this but Unfortunately it was not wide enough. And the best part is, the memory foam in them holds up. They are most comfortable and hug the foot. Like walking on air. Love Skechers.
I have been wearing Top-Siders for years. The sole began to separate from the body of the shoe at the toe. Boat shoes. These are the typical 80's Top-Siders. Quality leather and design. The price was well below one would expect to pay at a retail location. I have warrants Sperry Topsiders for years. Classic top Sider. A real boat shoe. Poor quality. I expect to wear these shoes for the next 10 years. Great shoes. I've been wearing Sperry Topsiders since my college days at Uva. Nice casual shoes.
Equal sizes in European size. Love them! But I love these slippers!!!!! My granddaughter loves them. Since I get a lot of things via Amazon, I know that I can get anything shipped fast and there is no Hassel. It's too bad they don't have half sizes. The fur inside makes them so warm. It's very warm and Confe, you can also walk comfortable. I ordered the kids 4 and they fit great. My mom and I both wear a women's size 7. Just perfect. :) Ugg never Disappoints. They are cozy and warm. They are not authentic.
Love Clark's shoes! I will not buy Clark's from Amazon again. Clark's are the best! Besides, they look great with jeans! I usually can't wear shoes al day...but I can these. I am on my feet all day. Love these shoes. Ouch! I love Clarks shoes. It's a good, "all purpose" shoe that I can wear comfortably all day. I have always loved the quality of Clark ’ s shoes having worn many different Clark styles over the years. I have several issues with my feet, and often have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably, but these are wonderful. Now that I ’ M home, I wear them to work every day. They are very comfortable and nice looking.
This is a great price for what is Arguably a better boot (Ugg model runs 200). Ordered a 6 in this and found that they were far too big. I love these boots!!!!!!!!! My daughter like her Emu boots. Very happy with this seller! This pair seems to be better, but time will tell. The squeaking was the only issue I had with the boots. The inside is warm and cozy. I ordered these boots when they were the gold box deal. I had to return them and order a 9. I tried to clean them with a Suede cleaner but they still have a water mark. Shipping was within a week and free. I wear a 9 and I ordered an 8 after reading all the reviews that said they run big and to order a size down. Couldnt even find these anywhere for less than 150, what a deal.
The true test is longer run 10+ which I will try soon and post updates. Nice shoes. 4.5 my favorite color is purple; that's why I chose this pair. The Trail shoes have a memory sole which absorbs the impact of distance walking. Fits very nicely, but is cheaply made. It's more like a pink. Im on my Feet10+ hours a day and need something Comfy yet durable. New balance shoes give me great foot support and are very comfortable. Love new balance shoes and particularly these. I purchased the wide width and these shoes did great. I usually wear a 8.5 in new balance, but the site recommended an 8. Great for running on the street or hiking. I really wanted to like these, but since I have narrow beyond belief heels, a "little large" is much too large for a running shoe.
No one is saying that they don't have arch support!! I've been buying Reebok Zig Tech running shoes for years now for their quality, durability and arch support. I keep buying them because they help me out. Mens size 7.5 was delivered. I just purchased this 5.0 version as a replacement. I have long, narrow feet and I like a good arch. A little narrow but as you wear them they soon stretch out to be just Wright. I have been consistently pleased by Reebok. I am exceptionally hard to Satisfywhen it comes to shoes. My son says they are the most comfortable athletic shoes he has ever worn. They're nice-looking shoes, durable and of obvious good quality, and they feel great. They don't run small like Nike or big like Adidas. They are just now starting to wear out on the inside. Reebok are the only shoes that fit right.
The most comfortable high heels I ’ ve ever worn! Very frustrating as these are really cute and the heel height is perfect for work. These are beautiful & so comfortable!!! They're absolutely beautiful, elegant, and so comfortable. They can dress up a pair of jeans or wear them for a dressy night out. I get compliments every time I wear them. These are gorgeous! I purchased 3 different colors of the beautiful Calvin Klein shoes. I ordered the nude pair also! Incredibly comfortable for a middle height but not super high heel. The strap across the middle of the shoe holds your foot in. Love the style of these shoes! Strap holding your foot in creates additional stability. If you do not want to show toes but still need to be presentable, this is the shoe!
He says he doesn't even have to wear his Orthotic inserts in them. I am on my feet all day at work and these shoes are much more comfortable than my last pair, which I paid more for. I purchased these shoes to wear for work, where I can spend over 12 hours at a time on my feet. I love these running shoes. I would recommend the Asics GEL excite 3 for anyone looking for a supportive shoe that will get them through long days. They fit well and I do a lot of walking so I get a new pair about every six months. Used for walking, not running. I don't use them for running, so they really don't have many miles on them, and I don't wear them every day. I like these shoes more than I thought I would. He says the fit great and are very comfortable. These feel very comfortable. Great shoe for the value. I recommend the carbon fiber Colorway. These are for at the gym, walking to and from the office, etc.
I bought these for my husband and he loves them! These are categorized as running shoes. Now this is a good looking pair of shoes! This is my fourth pair of Pumas. I'm reserving these for gym use only, no casual wear, and I actually want to go to gym them now just to put them on! I like the look and feel of these Puma Tazon 6 shoes. Add the fact that they are really sharp looking and I'm very happy with these shoes! Great shoe at a great price, slightly snug feel, but not truly size altering. My first and last Pumas. Not bad for the money but does need some quality control. They are very nice shoes. I thought it was odd to have this shoe larger than my other size 8 Pumas. He only wear Puma shoes at this point. Great looking shoe.
Wore them on a 14 mile hike out of the box. Great ankle support. This is my third pair of Salomon hiking boots. Very waterproof. Comfortable right out of the box. Best boots I have ever owned. Best hiking boots!!!!! Excellent boot. Very comfortable, rugged and provided excellent support. No break in period. These are great boots. Great boot. I love these boots. Great Lacing system.
Well made product as usual with keen. They are warm and comfortable. I wear a size 7 ladies and I got a 6 youth which will work great with warm socks. Like others have said: SIZING is way off. Highly recommended! These are pretty durable. You have to really jam it in there. Plus, they are easy on, easy off with the Velcro tab. I only buy keen brand for my kids because they have wide feet. Great looking boot, love it. My daughter loves the color. I got these for my almost 2 year old. My daughter is pleased and referred to the as "solid". They still look brand new after a few months of wearing them.
I bought my first pair of Vasque 4 years ago and I was hooked. Great ankle support. Horrible hiking boots. These boots are good quality, typical of Vasque. Comfortable right out of the box. So far these seem to be a durable boot. To date I have Backpacked approximately 150 miles in these boots. This is my fourth pair of Vasque breeze boots in twelve years. The soles are Vibrams and I don't feel alot of under foot issues. They are comfortable, rugged, waterproof and fit perfectly. No break in period. Love these boots! Great hiking boots. Great boot.
Original new balance quality! This is the second pair of the same shoe that did the exact same thing. I have worn new balance shoes for tennis for many years. I have worn new balance tennis shoes for years. Best tennis shoes I ever owned! This is one of the few tennis sneakers (and even casual shoes) for which the narrow width is really narrow. I ’ ve been wearing this line of shoes for years. These fit perfectly snug, and I may even go back to thinner socks. I had Plantar Fasciitis. They are very comfortable on the tennis court and well as off. They are exactly the same quality you would get in any Department or shoe store. Great shoe for a wide footed man. The 806 works best for me. The Mc806 new balance tennis shoe is not near the new balance 656 tennis shoe that I was hopping to replace.
They are not slippery even with soapy water. I use these for the shower at the gym. They fit perfectly. Love these shower shoes. Perfect for the pool. I purchased these to use in the shower at the gym. The slide is very comfortable. I don't like flip flops. These run super small I ordered a size bigger and they were still small. I recommend these shower shoes. I bought these to wear in the shower on a recent camping trip. They dry very quickly. They do not slip at all in the Shower~And they are comfortable! They are much more comfortable than thong flip flops.
The Brace RAISES my foot too high and the seam rubs the back of my foot an inch from the sole of my foot! It ’ s not even 3 months of wearing these boots and they are hurting my feet! I bought these boots 6 months ago 10 1/2 W and they fit perfect. Great boot! Seems like a solid work boot. I'll swear by Carhartt clothing, but these boots are garbage! Not waterproof!!!! Comfortable with no break in time needed. Good boot! If these hold up as well as the last did, they ’ ll be great boots! Just as described. I have to be careful with work boots. Everything is solid on this shoes except the tongues. Soles are great, they actually hold up very well in water.
Just got these, on my feet all day. The barn red is a nice color and not too bright. I got my usual shoe size, and they are very tight with my wool socks. I am trying another size and style and am praying it works. My feet stay nice and powder fresh all day. Keens feel great in me, so I've been committed. Comfortable, warm shoe with good support. Nice and warm for the winter. I just love the way they fit. Comfortable though, and they appear to have good tread. The Kaci winter Wp shoes are just what I was looking for. Plenty of toe room for those with wider feet. The keen shoes are adorable and very comfortable. I love keen shoes.
Great padding around the ankle. Also they look fine but once on my feet they looked more like a mans shoe. The material is very Breatheable and does not crowd your feet in the shoe. I wear a 9 in athletic shoes and this shoe fit perfectly lengthwise. The best sneakers I ’ ve worn in over a decade. They always fit well and last a while for me as Im on my feet 40+ hours a week. They ’ re very comfortable. I use them at the gym. Bought this shoe for an outdoor musical festival and it was very comfortable. I am normally a solid 7.5 in most shoes - with Adidas I always go with a 7 and it fits perfectly. These are super comfortable for working out and running on the treadmill. Nice shoe, but as you can see from my pictures it runs very large. Had these shoes from Februrary to May, only used while at work, sitting at a desk. I love Adidas!
It's because of the break in the sole across the toes for Flexabilty. These are excellent shoes for Crossfit! They made an amazing difference in my balance and control. They offer both good support and cushion. But I'm a runner so used to running shoes. Love love love my Nanos! They make me more comfortable and stable during my wod's and just all over. I use them daily at the gym on weight machines and treadmill. I received my shoes sooner than expected! I am never let down by Reebok Crossfit Nano's. And I really love the color scheme!! Awesome shoe! The toe box has plenty of room and I ordered my regular size. Great Crossfit shoe.
I use these for basketball. He really likes the Insoles which are similar to a memory foam. At first he thought they were just a regular pair of sneakers until he slipped his feet into them. If I could find a glue that worked well on leather and rubber together, I'd keep them. Now there is a piece of rubber on the sole flapping around. Needed a reasonable priced shoe as I'm sure he isn't done growing. Overall we are happy with these shoes and ordered a seconds pair. They are so Cushioned it's almost ridiculous I highly recommend if you are working all day on your feet. Afterwards, the bottom sole started to become unglued. The cloud foam is for real. Good fit, lots of cushion, good Traction on a hardwood court. Very comfortable and fits as expected. Seem to be wider than standard Shoes- but that's okay with me. He's on his feet most of the day and these shoes allow him to do so with minimal pain in his feet and back.
Warm and dry. Kamik boots are great quality. Kamik makes great quality winter boots. Love Kamik! Glad I ordered a size up because they seem to run a bit small. Kamik boots are the best kids boot for a reasonable price. It ’ s still summer here, but I knew I needed a new pair of snow boots and didn ’ t want to wait until the last minute. This is the 4TH year I have purchased Kamik boots for my son. I bought the black for my son and he has worn them all winter (and it ’ s still snowing). These are excellent quality boots, very warm, and will keep their feet cozy and dry! Perfect for my 8 year old. Removable/Replaceable liner is a good bonus. Anyway, I am an adult, but can wear kids size 4 shoes. Easy to put on and off.
My daughter loves them! Great school shoes. These shoes need Shined, as they are real leather. My daughter wore these everyday as part of her uniform. I've always purchased stride Rite shoes for my daughter. My 8 year old daughter loves them. Perfect for school uniform standards. High stride Rite quality! I love stride Rite shoes. Good leather shoes need a shoe Polish every now and again. Daughter wears these all day. I grew up wearing stride Rite shoes so my expectations where high. Great shoe and my daughters loved it. I purchased these shoes for my daughter to wear with her school uniform.
Apart from the first couple of wears, the shoe is Comfy and can see it lasting a good while. Gorgeous Trainers! Because these are leather they clean very easily with a wipe instead of having to put the cloth ones in the wash! Leather stays cleaner longer than canvas and dry too. Very happy customer. I got blisters on the back on my feet but I usually have with leather shoes. The shoes arrived really quickly before the estimated delivery and are surprisingly quite nice! She was absolutely delighted and impressed by my choice! Good quality of leather, converse are classic!!!! The leather seems good quality and the colour is white, and after a few weeks of wear and it hasn ’ t faded. I did like the looks of these shoes, however when on they made my feet look huge. This leather Trainers look exactly the same as canvas ones but are a bit tough. Great for school not sent into isolation with wrong shoes! Love the leather finish.
Kudos for Ryka offering a wide in a totally adorable shoe. Straps across the top of foot barely reach to other side to attach to Velcro closure. I have a lot of them! When foot is flexed, strap Pops off!!! I have a pink pair in size 7.5 that fit great. Love Ryka shoes. The sides of the heels are high on my ankles. This style has little or no support, and my experience is that the ankle feels slightly collapsed. Better support and cushioning than I would have expected from this type of casual shoe. They look nicer than a traditional athletic shoe. This is not a running shoe, so it need not be so flat. Very cute shoes. I tried washing them but it only improved the look slightly. I have no problem with the straps--they are long enough for me.
I've already gotten compliments and I've only worn them once! This shoe is fairly snug, even though I went up a size and a half. I decided to split the difference and ordered what should have been my normal size since I could return if wrong. They have some heel padding but no arch support which works well for me because I need to put in my own. I don't think I could wear them for hours and as they are leather I hope they will stretch a bit. Like other reviewers said, no arch support for these boots at all. They are soft and the distressed Taupe is gorgeous. Be patient and they'll soften up. The shoes take a lot of breaking in. Love these boots! They look great with Flowy short dresses and also with skinny jeans. The shoes are meant to get distressed easily and they really do. I really love the silhouette of classic Clarks desert boot, but I have issues with the thickness of the sole and boots overall. I wanted to love these shoes.
They fit perfect. I wear a size 7 & the boots fit like an extra wide 8. Came in original Hunter box and inserts. There was way too much room in the size 9 boots - even with the Hunter Fleece socks. The color is awesome. I can ’ t wait to actually wear them!! I love my Hunter boots. Love these boots. The are definitely authentic and great quality. Hunter rain boots are the best. They were way too big; not just a little loose but very much too big. They are so cute! Plus the shiny red color is really pretty! These boots definitely run large so I would size down if you're a half size.
I've seen the laces snap after much use and abuse, extended wear. Excellent hikers. I wear Mens size 9.5 and Thats what I ordered and the fit was perfect. The one real issue I had was that the Gore-Tex lining slipped constantly. They felt worlds better before I even laced them up. I have been wearing Danners for 25 years, USA and import for corrections work and I like them both. Comfortable right out of the box. This is my second pair of Danners. I've had several Danner boots in the past, they have always been great. I have the Usaf Danner boot for work and found I used them even at home. The first issue I had was that I like to use Paracord for my laces, and these boots don't have standard lace holes. The provided laces never stay tied. I walk 5 to 8 miles daily while working, outdoor dirt & mud and indoor concrete slab floors. I ordered wide (EE) but they were still very tight on the side of my feet.
Can walk in them all day. Xoxo, Erica Marie. Unfortunately to was too small plus the high front bothered the top of my foot, the front portion should be cut lower. There does, however, seem to be an extra bit of room at the toe, so perhaps I could have gone with a 7 1/2 instead. These are an unusual Fleshy/Peach/Nude color. I love these boots! I am glad to find this kind of boot I was looking for. I get so many compliments when I wear These-Even from men!!. But I live in SC so that's not a concern. Look nice with jeans, leggings or a skirt. I love these Booties!! I get compliments every time I wear them! Look great with leggings, skinny jeans or even a skirt! As a teacher, I'm on my feet most of the day.
I only gave 4 stars since a tiny piece of the leather on the steel toe Chiped off. Reviewing the timberland pro men's 6" pit boss Steel-Toe work boot. I bought these boots January of 2018. The steel toe digs into your toes. Awesome work boot. Best boots on the market. Solid steel toe. The last pair lasted me three years. Shoe is great, after two months of use five days a week. Still a good boot. Great steel toe boots. Solid pair of steel toes for the price. I purchased these boots for my son because his new job required Steel-Toe boots. These are great work boots.
This is a fantastic shoe. The colors look better in person and that's saying a lot. Fits great does have an odd tongue though. These are my first Saucony shoes. Great shoe overall! I wear a women's 9.5 and mistakenly ordered a men's 8 when I needed a men's 8.5, which is not in stock. Overall, I want to say these shoes fit great and are incredibly comfortable. A little bit roomy but still very Wearable, however I could have gone a half size down to a 10.5. It is attached to the side of the shoe. Saucony shoes fit me best of all the brands I have tried. They color looked amazing and they are very comfortable. They look really rice and offer really unique Colorways. I will buy these again. I ordered the wrong size Saucony grid sneakers.
Comfortable all day - and I am on my feet most of the time. I can ’ t wear them. Same comfort level as the sandals. Obviously I love fit flops. Unfortunately, I've started experiencing foot and ankle pain with just about every shoe I own...except my Fitflops. I have the sandals and they are the best fitting shoes. If you love fit flops like I do, you'll love these. The high gloss coating rolled back and peeled off. I have them in most colors and wear them almost 24/7. However all my open Fitflops a (Incl. These shoes are so wonderful, I even got my mother a pair! I love Fitflops. I could model about all of their styles from my own closet!!!!!!!! The color is fun - bright red.
The shoes came with GEL inserts for the heels and the front part, which is a nice touch. I can ’ t wait to wear them on my wedding day. Can ’ t wait to wear these at my wedding. Although these shoes are beautiful, I could not wear them longer than an hour. I had to remove them at my wedding and go barefoot. The heel is the perfect height as well. I bought the shoes for my wedding and they are perfect! They truly are elegant and very well made! It's very upsetting because they would have been perfect but the color was not right. After trying on multiple pairs of Badgley Mischka's, I ended up wearing these for my wedding. It turns out all the typical “ event ” shoes are made with 4 ” heels. I love it overall. They came with heel grips and cushions - one of the best purchases I have ever made! Beautiful shoe.
These boots are the most comfortable work boots I've ever worn. The rubber covering the steel toe on fourth pair began to tear after only 7 days of wear. Im not sure if I'd buy another pair of these the next time I need work boots. Great boot! They are not waterproof either. One of the most comfortable work boots I have ever used. However keen does have an awesome warranty. Not worth it. Very comfortable for such a heavy and substantial boot. This is the last pair of keen work boots I will ever buy. This is my second pair. When compared to the Justin water proof boots I now own you can see all the Stitching where water can get into your boots. I returned the first pair but they were so comfortable I tried another pair and after a week the same thing happened. The left foot also has wet spots on either side of the steel toe.
I love the adjustable back. Plenty of room! I wear a 7 but ordered a 6. These are great rain boots. But I have very slim legs so the boot was big around calf muscle. The adjustable buckle for the calf is also very helpful, particularly if you are wearing leggings vs. jeans. I am 5' 3" and my calves measured 16.5" in circumference. These boots are perfect for wearing during rain or damp weather. I love the boots but they're a little small. Super cute! The Clasps is very Classy looking and it ADJUSTS perfectly for those of us with larger calves. Love my Hunter boots! They fit perfectly! I love these boots.
Comfortable and great Traction. Glad I got them. These are the best Merrell shoes I have. Love these shoes! I bought these shoes to hike in Zion National Park and they were very comfortable. They are very light and airy. Love these hiking shoes. They are lightweight, and comfortable. Not a very good water shoe, which is what it's supposed to be used for. Had to find on Amazon because I have been checking with Merrell for several years and they stopped making these style shoes. Love how they fit straight out of the box! These shoes are amazing! They are super easy to clean. Best water shoes I've ever had!
Great boot for the price! The sole of this boot has started to separate from the boot. Great boots for the price. Very good quality comfortable boots for 50 bucks. Side Zipper makes for easy on and off. However, I wore them for 2 days in the field. Work boots for 5 months. Love these boots. Great boots. The one major drawback to these boots is the fact that they are not slip resistant. I've had these boots for a month. I wouldn't say these are water proof but Water-Resistant is more accurate. Light weight and comfortable.
My 8 year old loves these boots. They are super warm and Comfy. The boots are not waterproof. They keep his feet warm and dry. My son loves them. My son is 4 years old and wears a size 10 or 10.5 in every shoe brand. I bought these for my 5 year old. My son used these last year in bitter Chicago cold. Easy to put on and take off. Perfect and warm! Love the fur lining in the boots, easy to get on and off, and can't beat them for this price! There would be ice Breakers- metal pieces on the bottom. They fit as expected. Grear snow boot for kids.
It ’ s hard for me to find boots that fit my Legs- these were perfect! Very light weight! All in all it seemed like a nice study shoe. I ordered these for work and I will never order Crocs Online again. They are so light compared to others Ive had in the past, which really helps with the Clunkiness of wearing rain boots. It was muddy and we went through a Creek as well. But not flexible, my calves are not big, but these fit too snug over leggings. The return amount was deducted by over 60% just for trying them on because they consider that “ worn once “. I absolute love these boots!!!! Loved these rain boots! I always admired Crocs on others until I purchased these boots. I thought they might become less stiff with use, but no. They are comfortable and I had no issues with the calf fit, however, I am a Petite person.
Awesome hiking boots. I have had a pair of Merrell boots for about ten years and they were all leather. Was out in the rain with them the other day and my feet did not get wet. I have other pairs of Merrell shoes for running. Water proof. Comfortable right out of the box. But they are not waterproof. They fit perfectly. Overall a good boot. These are great boots. Merrell ’ s are great. No break in period. Bought these for a 5 hour hike in the Azores. Great hiking boot.
The issue is with the sole of the shoe that is glued on the shoe. These golf shoes look great and they are extremely comfortable. I have been buying Skechers golf shoes for several years. Let me start by saying I loved everything about this shoe .... for 4 rounds of golf. They also came with a spare set of laces, which are gray and I used those instead of the White. Nice looking shoe. The most comfortable golf shoes I have ever purchased. Extremely comfortable shoe. My feet felt fine all day golfing. Fit was excellent and comfort outstanding! My feet were a little warm but not uncomfortable at the end of the round. Very impressive. My second pair of Skechers golf shoes. Don't play golf on wet grass because these shoes are not water resistant.
I read some other reviews that stated the shoes fit as expected, but the 1 was very tight on him. I ordered these for my 8 year old son. In cookies, candies, juice won't help in these the things he loves. Loved these boots for a great trip to the mountains! Shoe laces come loose almost every time, at first I thought it was kids fault, tied myself, still get loose...go figure. My son wears a 12 1/2 ANS I ordered a 1 for growing room and they are super small. These boots fit my son perfectly! I brought these for my ten month old in he loved these boots, wouldn't take them off. In slept in them. Now he's the type of little guy takes off everything even his diapers, but he kept on these boots in dance all night. They keep his little Piggies warm and dry! Product arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition. I really like the product! These are not timberland boots!
Near perfect for my Feer if my feet were not wide. I did not realize how many different and confusing choices there are in Mizuno running shoes. I ’ m not a runner, but I do a lot of walking & cross training. This is my 4TH shoe in the wave rider. I have had a several of these same shoes in other models. I ended up returning the inserts because the shoe itself had all the cushion I needed. Will have to return them. Great running shoe. I have Supinated feet with extremely high arches. The cushion is very comfortable, everything is soft and just right. I returned them the next day. Have worn wave riders for probably 12 years. And they ’ re perfect for that. I was recommended Mizuno's by a specialty running store and have been buying them for years.
Super cute and trendy. My foot was slipping out of them. There is no arch support, but I bought Insoles which fixed that. I got a 7.5 after reading the reviews. The size is right but feet would slip out when walking. Laces were tightened. Shoe is super heavy and is very uncomfortable. They are heavier than I expected so it may not be suitable for long walks. May go for the White...love love love the little boost of the platform. I love the platform style and they are so comfortable. Super cute! These shoes are so cute and hip! The souls are filthy as though someone has already worn them as well as the inside of the shoes. Wish I can return, but I threw away the box already.
They fit great. I tried them on right when I got the package and was amazed that they fit perfectly. They do start to slip down a bit when I'm walking, but it's not annoying and I'm able to pull them up again. These boots are absolutely amazing! These are just pull up and it stretches. I love these boots! These boots are super cute and I love the fit! They definitely fit best when worn over jeans. I got the color Taupe & am very happy with the color. They actually enhanced the Skinnyness! Stretchy for knees & calves. They really are perfect! They fit like slouch boots now. I have thicker thighs and calves and usually have to buy wide calf boots.
I was surprised to find that the shoe is not very comfortable for running and doesn ’ t have Much/Any arch support. Decent shoes. Son loves them. It's as light as Asics running shoes while providing good cushions. I usually wear an 11 in boots cause I put inserts inside. Great shoes for the money so far. Not narrow and I have pretty average feet. Great comfortable running shoes. We buy only UA since his first pair 4 years ago. Very roomy in the toes, which I think is good. The tongue at the top of the shoe does not cover the entire top part of my foot! I purchased these and every time I wear them, they cushion my heel so I feel the pain less each day. I liked my 1ST pair, and this is my 2ND pair:). Light and comfortable.
I found this boot runs slightly small. It ’ s 5 degrees f outside with snow and ice. My feet stay warm and dry. Glad I got them a Half-Size larger than I normally do. I only tried them on temporarily before returning them because I Didnt end up needing them. Great boot, but order a full size larger than usual. Fortunately, I have a friend they fit perfectly and who loves them. Well made, sturdy, nice tread that grips well on ice and snow, and warm! Best winter boots I have ever owned! Wore these this winter. I only tried them on and they were a bit tighter than expected, returning for a half size up. Very comfortable and quite warm for winter snow hiking. These keep my feet warm and protected. Perfect in snow!
Id never lift in running shoes again. They run a little narrow to fit like a glove. If you have narrow feet, and find regular shoes a little too roomy, however, these would be perfect for you. The only con is that the inside side of the shoe is grey and extremely hideous. I got a blister on a middle toe. My foot is not wide. Shoes were a bit of an odd size. 5 stars if they can come up with some better colors. They are on the narrow side - even for me and I have Regular/Slightly narrow width feet. The material is very Breathable and really lightweight. Very good for weight lifting. Otherwise, I like the fit a feel. I have high arches and these provide all the support I need for hard Sprints and jumping. These shoes are great fit.
No break in. I selected the full grain leather. Very light and comfortable. Problem for me with them is they made my feet sweat tremendously. On the other side, it does not breath, at all, not even a little. Comfortable right out of the box. Great boots! They are waterproof. Love these boots. This is my second pair of Danner boots this year. Thanks Danner. These are the most comfortable hiking boots I have ever owned. I love Danner boots.
My Fitbit versa 2 is my third Fitbit, and now my Favorite❤️. Have really enjoyed the sleep pattern monitor, as it shows how I need to improve my sleep habits. Battery lasts for days. The watch is great. I love the sleep tracking. The step count is accurate enough. The battery life is great! It stopped working after 4 months. This is my second Fitbit. Very nice, its my first smart watch and I love it!! I love this watch. This watch is awesome. I love my Fitbit!
I need my phone with me, since my Fitbit does not have Gps. You don't even know you are wearing it because it is so comfortable. It fits perfectly. I could not get my phone 5S out of the belt because the openings are too small. I wear it every time I run. I use this for running every time. I love this belt. It holds my phone in case that it is in. Stays in place. I use this to carry my phone and a revolver. I love my Flipbelt. Keeps my Keys and phone in place, and it's so comfortable I forget it's on. It fits my phone and Keys in there and it doesn ’ t bounce when I run. I ordered a size smaller.
Very roomy. I love this bag!! It comes with a shoulder strap for cross body but the handles are long enough to put over your shoulder. Perfect size. Look for a smaller bag. Like the shoulder strap. The Cross-Body strap is easily adjustable and the handle straps are a great length. I purchased this bag for travelling. Bag is perfect size. I got this bag as a work TOTE. She loves it, able to carry water bottles and her food plus snacks and there is still more room. Needed a clear bag for work. Great bag. I would think this bag is too large to carry as a purse, but you could if you have a lot of stuff.
And it keeps you dry. The strap on the sleeve broke the first time I used it. It ’ s huge. This is a great umbrella. Love this umbrella. This umbrella is huge. I like this umbrella. Easy to open and close. It also comes with a lovely carrying case that has an arm strap. Broke after using it 3-4 times. Great coverage. Great sturdy umbrella. Used in the rain and indeed I did not get wet. I had bought 2 of these umbrella for my mother and after she said how awesome they are I purchased another 2 umbrellas for me!
You can add water or sand to it, but it holds fine in my carpeted living room without it. My 2 1/2 yr old loves it! My 2 Kiddos (4 & 7) loves this hoop!! This is a great basketball set. My child is almost 4 years and is 42" tall. My 2 1/2 year old loves it. It goes up to six feet tall and all day me and my friends were Dunking on it! It is adjustable as he grow. The 4 yr old is tall and hoop is very easy to adjust up and down. This is hands down one of the best toy purchases I have made. The pole is thick and sturdy. Without water in the base, the basketball hoop does wobble a lot. Some father son bonding time love watching them. Good quality and easy to assemble.
It's massive, and it stays dry in rain. Very spacious. Great family tent. Love this tent. Easy to set up. This tent is great. We bought this tent for our first camping trip as a family. I cannot say how it does in the rain because it didn't rain when we used it. This tent is huge! Very nice tent for the money. We had a queen and twin size air mattresses and still had plenty of room. Great tent. We are a family of four + Mutt and will have plenty of room for sleep Pads/Cots + gear. Very happy with this tent.
About 10 minutes to set up. The rain fly works wonderfully. This tent was very spacious and easy to set up. This is a good tent. Easy to set up. This tent is perfect for two people. Bought this for a camping trip. I love this tent. Good ventilation. Had to sleep in the tent with the door wide open. Spent one night in the tent, woke up to it raining. Fits a queen size air Mattress with room to spare. Bought this tent for our 11 Yo kid for overnight camping trip. Great tent.
Great little grill. This camp stove is perfect. Works great. The stove gets so hot that it Melts the grill? Looking at other Coleman stoves like it reveals that they are all like that. A high performance Burner, and a great grill too. When the flame goes out you have to lift the grill with food on it in order to Relight it. The grill really works great and I also bought the Coleman Griddle and it works great. We have used this Stove/Grill on several camping trips. They could have add fire starter. Easy to clean. The side Burner is just a nice plus for this very functional Grille/Stove. I love this grill! I use it on our patio for Grilling.
This bench even declines! Easy to adjust. This thing is rock solid. The bench is very sturdy and well designed. Easy to assemble. Very solid well made bench. The bench seems to be sturdy and functional. Perfect for the home gym. - it took about 15 Mins to put together. I use it with the Bowflex 1052's and there are no issues. I am very happy with this purchase. I love this bench!! Great bench. Excellent bench.
The bikes is smooth and comfortable. Easy to assemble. I love this bike! Excellent bike. I love riding this sturdy bike. Good exercise bike. Great bike!! The heart rate monitoring does not work. Very quiet and smooth. It took about an hour to put together. Easy to put together. This bike is comfortable and easy to use. The seat is very comfortable. Good instructions! 😀.
Good rack for the price. For the price it was perfect for my garage gym during this Covid Craziness. My hubby uses it for pull UPS. Easy to assemble. Perfect for a home gym. It Wobbles back and forth very bad. Very sturdy. My power rack came in with missing parts. Fantastic squat Rack/Pull-Up bar for the price. Very solid. Perfect for Pull-Ups and for a squat rack! Great rack! Anyway, I use this mainly for my yoga Trapeze. Granted, I'm not squatting 500 lbs on it.
Love these gloves. Comfortable, good wrist support, and easy to take off. I've been lifting for 30 years, used lots of equipment, and shed tears over the demise of harbinger. The best gym gloves Ive ever owned!! Overall, they do a great job protecting your hands and the built-in wrist wraps are a great feature. These are the best gloves I've used. Excellent padding and fits very well. These gloves are comfortable! Great gloves. Great grip. Excellent grip. These lifting gloves are superior to other types of gloves I've had in the past. Great Weightlifting gloves. The wrist support is amazing!
Perfect size for my 6 year old son. Holds air well. The colors are bright and vibrant! Very nice ball. The child's favorite color is green and it is a perfect Soccer ball for a beginner. I didn't realize it until we had pumped air into it. It's otherwise a beautiful ball and my daughter loved it! No kid on his 40+ kid practice squad has this ball, so it ’ s easier to find him! This Soccer ball will give hours of fun. Great Soccer ball for the price. Great ball! The color is vibrant. Easy to inflate. Bought this Soccer ball for my 6 yr old boy and he loved it.
The mask fits great didn't fog up. Great view played in damp weather an no Fogging at all. Love this mask. It has great vision range. By far the best mask I've ever owned. I have already suggested this mask to friends. Can buy replacement lens of just about any color tint or Hd. Need a good Shemag for neck protection. It's well worth the money. I used it for 4 hours the other day and not once did it give me any problems. Protection is solid. Only problem is it is not deigned for glasses. Great mask. Excellent field of view, light weight, yet sturdy design.
The screen is great and easy to read. I love my Garmin! And the battery life is amazing! But the sleep tracking is quite bad. The heart rate monitor seems to be accurate. I love this Tracker! The battery lasts about a week. Connects well with Garmin connect App and I like the features that App has. It is not very accurate as far as steps and stairs climbed. It is waterproof. It is not accurate. Great for tracking steps but lacking accuracy in stair climbing and activity tracking. I wanted this to track my fitness while I walk and the Garmin connect App is awesome as well. The touch screen just randomly stopped working day two.
The speeds always seem to be accurate although I don't have another gun to compare it to. I will sometimes get two readings from one throw or the velocity reading is clearly way off. This speed gun works great! Seems to be very accurate. I thought the readings were way off and very inaccurate when using it for baseball pitching. Using it for baseball and it works great. I purchased this gun to measure tennis serve speed. Beware- this is a no return policy! Says accurate within 1 mph, and is off by at least 5 mph. Great radar gun. Because the product doesn't begin measuring speed until 10 mph, it is useless on our 5 mph site. My son throws approximately 78 to 80 mph and the speed gun does not register anything. Use it for baseball pitching speeds. I tested the accuracy with our Zooka pitching machine and it was very close.
It is very quiet. If you want to learn how to operate the programs, you have to go to the Website for the Info. With the covers off the noise still remains. Love, love the bike! Easy to assemble. The heart rate sensors don't work very well. The bike seems sturdy. This is a great bike for the price. No issues everything works as advertised. The manual States that a wire or sensor may be faulty. Wasn't hard to put together. I've been using this exercise bike for roughly 8 months. This is an excellent machine! When it arrived, the box it was shipped in was in very poor shape.
Great glove. Made of nice material, and good flexibility and grip. Grip the bat properly and your elbows will automatically fall into place. I ordered the Xls and they fit a bit snug...however they are still a decent buy and will stretch with use. Not as much padding as I expected based on the name but still more padding than some of the basic gloves at big 5. These are nice gloves. These gloves have been a good fit and have held up well through the first few games of the season. Great fit and comfort. It makes the bat feel a lot lighter. My daughter loved these gloves. I've had some pairs last me years before. Seem to work as advertised. My son plays somewhere in the neighborhood of 50+ games over the summer and he wore the same batting gloves every game. Excellent batting glove.
This is the best toy Everrrrr! This DUNE buggy is awesome!! Back, a few days in it stop working! My kids love this. Goes great on the grass and pavement. My boys love this! The battery life is great. 5 year old loves it! Battery lasts closer to an hour. My 8 year old loves it! She loves it rides it almost everyday. It is fast and very fun! Battery lasts about 30-40 minutes. Lots of fun for my 9 year old.
This is a real plus for exercising my arms, weakest part of me. Quality is really good. It is not too stiff. I usually do yoga but decided to add this to my routine. Many videos Online to use with it. Same type of ring I use in my Pilates mat class at the gym. I like it so far! Very easy to use and you can get the workouts on Youtube to try new stuff with it. This is the same as at physical therapy. The resistance of the ring is a nice medium. It provides a nice workout without needing much equipment. It's meant to simply give a good resistance. Love this Pilates ring. The ad promises a workout guide.
I love this type of grill setup. Big enough to cook on for 5 people. We use it over the fire a lot. I wish there was a chain or something connecting the grill to one of the poles, as it swings around quite a bit. Easy to put together, good size grill, and the fact that it was adjustable up and down allowed us to cook like pro's. The adjustable chain and pole lock works very well. Turning foods is a two handed job, one to flip and one to hold the grill with a pair of tongs. Adjustable grate height for any size fire. I ’ ve used other tripods before that worked great, so I have to discourage people from buying this one. It ’ s easy to adjust the height of the rack when it ’ s over the flame so you can control temperature. Therefore we were unable to use this on our camping trip. I wanted to like this tripod, but Unfortunately, it wasn ’ t built well. Under normal loads it worked as advertised.
Very comfortable and warm. Received my skates on time! My only Gripe about these skates is that the laces are not high in quality, so I recommend getting better laces. So we have had these skates for less than a month and have had to have them repaired twice! Perfect skates for beginners. I bought these skates for my four year old daughter. I wear a size 6 1/2. I bought these skates for my daughter who just learning to skate. My daughter has wide feet, so the ice skates that we rent pinched and were painful. Comfortable beginner figure skate. These skates are very comfortable and fit well. I bought these skates for my daughter. She tested them on the ice today and absolutely loved them. Must be sharpened upon arrival.
Other than that, sound is great. Feed calls and Attractor calling roll out easy with a little practice, check Youtube for duck commander and they will show you how. Great call! Wet weather or ice cold. Awesome duck call! I replaced it with this call. Good call. I'm not a Hunter, and certainly no duck or call expert, but I can make it sound well enough like the ducks. Easy to blow, loud, excellent tone, and very good at the hail, feeding, quack, and come back calls. Easy to clean and tune. It's my first duck commander call. It arrived packaged well too. Sounds great. This duck call was purchased for my son-in-law for his birthday.
Very fast, and very light. I should ’ ve stuck with my old jump rope. Love the color. Easy to adjust. This rope is very smooth and fast. The rope is light and fast. I really like this jump rope. Great rope! I love this jump rope. Love that it comes with an extra Cable! This rope is great. Nice speed rope. I love these ropes! This is a lightweight jump rope.
Pump worked well and pressure gauge is pretty accurate. I got it for Portability, pressure gauge and Presta valve type. A frame clamp is included for your bicycle but I will be keeping this on my Motorcycle for emergencies. The pump in itself works great. You will loose air that way as soon as you touch the release valve. One of the best Presta valve connections I have had the pleasure to use. This pump is not a good fit for Presta valves. I don't like that the end cap on the Red portion hits the silver tube on the up stroke, but just my quirk. This pump is very well made. Great little pump. I use it on my road bike and got all the pressure normalized. Seems to work pretty well for a hand pump. The Presta adapter works great for Decoring valves, fantastic in the side if a trial. This is an awesome pump.
Great reel. The drag is smooth and has some real stopping power. Very smooth and durable! Powerful salmon reel. Love this fishing reel. Excellent reel. Great drag system. I highly recommend this reel as it has held up to travel, Kayaking, pier and surf fishing. I have caught plenty of fish on this reel and there is nothing wrong with it and it appears to be the highest quality. I have it on my surf rod and absolutely love it. Very smooth and that Ht100 drag is nice. I bought the Penn battle II 4000 for inshore fishing. I used for shore casting and Jigging.
Not worth the money and they adjust but they dont fit correct when adjusted. The adjustable feature is awesome if they are comfortable for you. Bought these for my 8 year old daughter. These are great, I love these skates. I wear a size 7.5 in woman and I bought these in a large and they fit perfectly! She blades outside and these seem to roll very smooth. Overall, spend 10-15 dollars more and get a better skate. I gifted them to a friend who wears a size 8 and has very narrow Feet-They are comfortable for her. These Rollerblades were too big and very tight on the ankles even when it wasn ’ t fastened. Look for a more traditional Online skate with rope laces and clips for support. I thought these would be a fun way to keep up with them and get exercise. The are adjustable to size and fit well. My daughter really loves these skates. However, the hard part of the boot is adjustable.
Good grip. It ’ s a Kettlebell. Love the smooth handle. I got the 15 lb one. I bought the 35 lb kettle Bell. Great Kettlebell. Some Trainers actually recommend removing the paint on the handle and treating it with chalk anyway. We have been looking for a 35-Lb kettle Bell reasonably priced for a while. Some of the black coating had broken off the handle in transit, leaving the cast iron exposed. Arrived in perfect condition. And free shipping! This is a great small Kettlebell. Compared to the prices for Kettlebells I could find locally, this was such a great deal. There was also a minor but deep chip in the coating on the face of the Kettlebell, but it is mostly cosmetic.
I swim laps in a pool and I use fins for resistance. Will be taking them on our next Snorkeling trip. They provided great Traction so there was little wasted motion on each Paddle stroke. They offer enough dexterity to allow me to adjust my goggles or operate my watch. I ordered a medium large and my hands are about 7" from middle finger to wrist, fits great. Good gloves. Very happy with my purchase. I initially ordered the wrong size and they were too small. I love these gloves. So order a size larger. I cannot comment on durability yet. They provide additional resistance, in a very gentle way. I move much quicker through the water. I use them for a little added water resistance while swimming to tone my arms.
Cheaply made. This is a well made Enamelware pot with a real glass top. The glass lip on the lid broke off into the coffee pot lid off to fill with water and coffee. Also the lid for the percolator doesn't fit well so it falls off when I pour unless I remember to hold it on. The coffee pot seemed fine but the guts were flimsy and cheap. Heavy duty, stood up to the hot direct campfire every morning. Makes great coffee! This percolator makes delicious coffee. I like percolator coffee. The coffee pot is great - solidly built. The basket will not stand straight up, it flops against the sides, every time. Nothing is better that coffee over the camp fire. I loved the coffee pot until the glass top broke while brewing a pot of coffee. Make coffee in a sock.
Love this scope. I use it on an air rifle. Good scope for the price. I mounted this scope on a 10/22. Tons of features you can't find on a scope for less than double the price of this one. Very clear glass. Reticle is straight and it holds zero. It sighted in easily. 3 shots at 50 yards and was zeroed. I have only used it on targets, but the OPTICS are very clear, and the zoom is very good. I have it mounted on my s & W M & P15. Holds zero very well. So far I have to say for $86 I highly recommend this scope! Anxious to get it sighted in.
Really nice Lacrosse balls. He's become a ball Snob. Our dog seems to like the fact that they bounce higher and roll much farther that other balls. The rubber smell is overwhelming and Stinks up an entire room. Great Lacrosse balls. Good quality lax balls. I mean, I don ’ t use these balls for Lacrosse, but they ’ re great for my young piano students to bounce and develop Hand-Eye coordination. Appear to be good quality lax balls and I would recommend them. These are good Lacrosse balls that are decently priced. Love the colors and the $. He's a great beginning Player, but his shots sail wide sometimes. My boys use these for Lacrosse practice at home or the park. He had one chewed up in about 5 minutes. If you don't have a Lacrosse ball...or 5...in your life, buy these!
Bought 16 oz version and they are small. So fake! Highly recommend these gloves for Muay Thai. With wraps, they fit perfectly. They all recommend these gloves. Good wrist support with the Velcro straps. Gloves fit great! But they have great padding. There is enough padding to protect my knuckles. Great gloves. Excellent quality gloves. I love these gloves. I used to have a few good Fairtex gloves. Excellent gloves.
Took me about an hour to set up. This is a very well-made, sturdy bench. I don't really trust the squat rack for this reason. It is sturdy enough for home use but does not feel safe at higher weights over 200 lbs. Generally a decent bench. Love the preacher curl. Versatility is perfect for home gym. Easy to assemble and is solid construction. Instructions were also easy to follow. The leg extension is the only thing I cant get a decent position on. I am happy with this bench. Great bench. It works if you use and extremely narrow grip. Nice bench for the price.
Doesn't bounce when I run. Its large enough to hold my smart phone and Id. "is that a Fanny pack?!". Great for running! Stays in place. Highly recommend. I love this belt. I can fit my phone and a small snack. The funny part is that a phone case would not fit on the phone and inside the pouch because it is just too big. I forget it's there. Doesn't bounce. I used this recently to hold my phone while hiking. Love this belt. Perfect for my Iphone Xi.
I love how my car doesn ’ t get soaked and how easy it is to get in and out of buildings without getting wet. I will only buy this kind of umbrella now! I love the colors. This umbrella is very sturdy and convenient to use. I have used it in the rain and in the sun; it works great in both! Easy to open and close. I highly recommend this umbrella! You can get in and out of the car without getting wet. Cloud print on the underside of the umbrella is too cute. Beautiful umbrella! Love the design. I love this umbrella! I get so many compliments on this umbrella!
Also, I've had this for a few months, use it a few times a week and seems to be holding up just fine. This is awesome, great for push UPS and Crunches. It has all the grips and it is very sturdy! This will not fit a standard American wood door frame. This product is weak! Easy to assemble. Nothing a little elbow grease can't remove, or paint can't cover. This fits in the doorway without any issues. If the door frame was 3" wider or if the kit included a 3" spacer, it would be secure and would work. Excellent pull up bar. We kept it because it would have been difficult to take apart and ship back. Very solid and sturdy. It's extremely easy to put up or take down and has been 100% stable so far. My 6Yo can do three Pull-Ups and it ’ s amusing.
Seriously great price for all these balls. The ball looked great upon in initial inflation. 10 ” ball with Dodge ball like outer texture. I was Pooped after two balls! Should send a couple of plastic needles or a better pump altogether. By March 2018 all 6 balls were extremely lopsided and useless for any game that requires a straight bounce. I turned to my small air compressor. My kids love playing wall ball and these balls couldn't even handle that after gentle usage after a month. Great for Dodgeball. Every last one of them cracked and leaked air within a couple weeks. The kids actually played during recess! We've only used them for a few weeks, and have kept them inside when not being used. My kids jump around with these in their Trampoline and have a ball with them!
Easy to install. Good tires for the price. I use on my motorized bicycle. This tire replaced a worn and damaged tire on one of Myschwinn discover or Solitaire hybrid bikes with 700C wheels. Good tire. These are very nice tires. Nice tires. I bought 2 of these tire to replace the city tires on my mountain bike. I ride on the streets but I wouldn't hesitate to take it off road. I do 70 for the street and the ride is fast, but still Smooths out the bumps nicely! Very smooth riding. It's a bike tire! These tires replaced the mountain bike tires on my wife's bike.
Love this scale. Aria Syncs with the App and I can see my weight auto update their. Seems to be very accurate. Use with my Fitbit surge and the Iphone App. Instead of having to log my weight, I just step on the scale and weigh myself. Easy to set up. I love that I don't have to write down my weight and keep track of my own progress. Nothing but an error message. Just step on and step off. Update: stopped working after 8 months. I love how it Syncs with my Fitbit account. I love this scale. It was easy to setup and integrate with my Fitbit account.
I ’ ve washed them twice. Worked great. They are potato sacks. They smell like wet paint. Strong sturdy material. I was very satisfied with the speed of delivery & the quality of the product. The sack races were a highlight. Used for a voodoo doll Halloween costume for my daughter. Don't leave these in a closed room if smells bother you. Lots of fun. Very good large jute bag. They were large and made a fun prop. So we used these sacks for a race with our Grandshuggas. Fine for adults and kids.
They wash well and keep their shape. I'm having trouble with my feet and ankles swelling, my Doc told me to get some compression stockings and I was elated to find these. I love these socks. The socks are very comfortable. Very comfortable compression socks! Snug but not too tight. I would highly recommend these to anyone needing compression socks. They ’ re not too tight like some of the compression socks I ’ ve used in the past and they are very comfortable to wear all day. I ordered a L/Xl and I wear a size 10 shoe. I love these compression socks! These socks are great! These socks are very thin. Love the colors.
Clear sight picture. I will always go with Bushnell every time they are high quality and in the "working man's price range" great scope! Bushnell is back!! I mounted it on my Ar-15 and works well for what it is. Great scope for the price. Sighted in at 100 yards with 4 rounds. Very clear OPTICS. Clear and accurate. I fired 8 more rounds with the same results. A unbelievable value for the price, photo is shooting group at 100 yards on a Simi windy day. Considering the price point, this is a great hunting scope for inside 200 yards. Holds zero. For a sub $100 scope it ’ s hard to beat.
It came with the pump so inflating it is easy. I am already familiar with the Bosu because it is one of my Go-To pieces of equipment at the gym. Perfect addition to any home gym. Sadly, it doesn ’ t hold the air. It was easy to inflate. I love this Bosu ball. Great for balance and mat Pilates! Love using a Bosu at the gym and now love having it for my home gym! I love my Bosu. Love the Bosu balance Trainer. I was in physical therapy for my ankle and was using this. Super easy to inflate. I love to use it for doing Squats and balancing exercises. Such a great addition to my home gym.
These skates are okay for getting started, but the Toe-Stop and the wheels are not good at all. Theses skates are fantastic. One for me, one for my grand daughter and a few for toys for Tots. I would be miserable if I even attempted to skate in these. I had to go to a skate shop and spend 100 dollars to get better wheels put on. Good enough if you just want to some outdoor skates to mess around with, but not suitable for derby. These skates are reasonable price-wise, look good, comfortable to wear, and it's a good way to exercise! I was looking for some cheap skates to practice my jam skating ... My son loves the skates. He only uses them in the Rink, not outside, so I can't say how that experience would be with these. I got a size 6 (men ’ s) and I wear a 7.5 women ’ s and they fits perfectly. So far I've used these skates once and they worked well. The left skate pulled to the right even after having someone try to fix the problem. I tried them on and I have wide feet and they fit just fine.
So I bought these. I love my Nordic lifting knee sleeves! The knee sleeves fit very well. Helps my Squats! I wear them while doing heavy Squats and Deadlifts. Great knee sleeves. Love these knee sleeves. I put them on and my knee pain went away. I use these for Squats and dead LIFTS. I've been doing Squats 3 times a week for the past 3 months. Great sleeves. Great support. These are great knee sleeves. They kept my knees warm during training.
This racket is great! This is an awesome racket. Perfect for beginners. My Boyfriend and I are beginners who just like to hit the ball back and forth occasionally. Good racket. Great Racquet for the price. Good control and large sweet spot. We play tennis every weekend now! Nice tennis racket. Feels nice and light. This Racquet works great for me. Good for beginners. Light weight. This racket is quite light as well.
Perfect fit for my 5-6 year old daughter. They don't leak! Highly recommended. The fun coloring also makes them easy to identify. They never fog up or leak. These fit my 6 year old daughter great. These goggles are great! I got this for my daughter who has swim lessons. Has used them multiple summers for play and for swim team. They do, however, have pretty good suction and I haven't seen them fog on him. He joined a swim team and the Tyr brand is what they use for swim equipment. Definitely recommend for young kids in competitive swimming, and of course they are also fine for leisure swimming. Great fit. Excellent goggles for the price.
Bought this for my son for Christmas. Battery life is excellent too! The sound is good. Love this hat! Was a gift for our 23 year old son. Also is very warm. Good sound quality. Sound is pretty good and the quality is good. Perfect gift for our son! The sound quality is really good and crystal clear. Great idea, but fit on some is a little large (I bought 4), and the hat is a little tall. Says the sound quality is really good. It connected to my Iphone 6 quickly. Good sound for the price and the sound does not bleed to neighbors.
It does the job. Easy to install. Instructions were very clear. Construction is solid. Strong and sturdy pull up bar. Marked stud locations with stud finder. We ended up mounting 2X6's on the wall first as others had suggested. You can do all of the many kinds of pull UPS with this bar. This thing is 100X easier and safer than a Doorway-Mounted pull up bar. This dip station and their wall mounted pull up bar. This Pull-Up bar has been great. I'm 200 lbs and it was still very solid. This bar sports multiple grips and grip angles. The installation was Straight-Forward (ESP.
