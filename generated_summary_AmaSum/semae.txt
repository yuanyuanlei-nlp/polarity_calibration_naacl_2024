It replaced the one we bought 4 years ago.	I had two Fire TV's and 2 Fire Sticks and all had connection problems with the remotes.	We had been using the Netflicks mail order movies for years.	I cut the cord about 2 years ago and have been using my TV smart aspects to access Netflix and Amazon Prime but there's only so many videos and movies on those things and YouTube doesn't provide you
So happy with this purchase, everything from the delivery to the operation of the product, we will be needing another television soon for another room in our home, will probably purchase this one again.	And with the 240 refresh rate, even our cats LOVE to watch TV now, especially shows with birds and butterflies in them!	The smart features were great at first, but when you try and use them for streaming, everything lags or
She used them most of the flight, even when not watching a movie she used them to just quiet the background noise.	Loved these headphones for about six months - great on planes, work calls, running, or blocking out noise when you just want to relax on the subway.	If you have street noise, hotel room noise, snoring sleep partners, these will help you shut out the world and get to sleep!	Brilliant for the
Love the i7 8700k, one of the best gaming processors on the market.	Have not delidded or OC'd yet so no numbers, but on an asus z370e and the MCE on, she rarely gets over 60c af stress test loads.	Use this primarily for programming, and internet things.	It helps to have the 1080 video card, but this processor was a big improvement over the i5	Bought this instead of its K version because I
Came just as the seller had noted, was all brand new with necessary accessories.	i love them service ,good and honest ,what they advert,i get that ,thanks	Holy macorole, I just found out my wife bought this camera under my account.	I am a professional photographer - though I have a Canon 7D, I've been renting a Canon 5D IV from a local camera shop for awhile now.	I called Canon, they said they’d heard
I did have an older laptop running Win 7 that I had to manually install drivers on, but not a problem.	I travel 40 weeks a year, so I will update this review in a few months to let you know how its going, I am a little nervous about the plug issues people have been having but for $100 its worth it even if only for 6 months!	However, I did not see that
We’ve had this TV for less than two months and worked great, but now will never connect to the internet.	Other than this issue, the TV has worked well for months.	Order was fulfilled by Best Buy, so had to deal with them originally.	All of our old TVs had this feature, which has been a savior.	before i got this tv, i'd been using, like, a glorified computer monitor that my friend gave me
It’s definitely an upgrade from my factory stereo.	It loses synch a lot.	Increased the performance of stock speakers.	It works fine but it does not fit in my 2002 Ford F-250 even though it says it does.	Need a few extras to make this work perfectly, but overall great product!	Bought the harness kit, bought 2din plastic kit to mount.	pioneer the name says it all .... lots of bang for the buck !!!
They just tried charging me $30 bucks for techinical support when THEIR app stopped working... even when I had called in before the warranty expired with the same issue, they still wouldn't honor it.	If you call them and ask about this, they will tell you that right out.	In about 3 minutes, I went from setup to watching TV.	Watched this years US Tennis Open from Stawell, Somerset England.	It was only a couple
Bought this mostly for the 50mm and the F1.8, and because of great price, I did not like the older models because I invested in bigger and larger lenses	Bought them for my first international travel, I didn't expect to use them soooo much when I got them!	I have a 17 month old daughter, and a few years of photography experience.	Since I had my son, I was looking for a lens to use
You would suspect Sennheiser, AKG and Beyer to be better.This product though does provide the best quality achievable in this price range.	Overall good product, would recommend.	Brilliant headphones, got them in the Black Friday sales so they were a fantastic price.	Cheaply made.Suspicious build quality.Will not last.Average sound,nothing to write home about.Bang Olufsen discontinued nice H6 model to flood market with these.Not worth 300,150,maybe 50.Returning.	Great quality headphones, good looking, fantastic sound quality and
bought as a gift for son, now grand daughter may get one.	If you use ChromeOS a lot, these should be familiar features.	I do wish they had a black model, but few other complaints.	I bought this Chromebook as a replacement for my 6 year old MacBook, which was causing me nothing bur problems.	After several days, I have only one complaint.	Batteries were deffective, so I had to return the product twice.	My
I like the Q camera but, I had to buy a second Q camera because the first one stopped working after less than a year.	For me, the 7 days cloud free account was the most important because, if someone comes to rob you, don't you think they will take your camera and the SD card with them?	Got them all over the place, VERY EASY and super flexible.	After all these years hassling with
would buy again, and actually did buy the same tv in a 49" version also, and also happy with that one.	We were ready to upgrade our living room tv to 4K, did extensive research, and determined this was the best choice for the very best price.	If it were possible to use this TV as just that, it would be wonderful.	However, this picture seems even better than than before.	Welove the picture quality,
i got my first camera when i was 8 and now i'm 70. i've always had fun with photography, but i'm very disappointed now.	Of these, the D3300 was clearly the best value for money.	I bought this as an upgrade to a 10 year old, 4MP Nikon.	I got this right before a trip to China and while I wish I had more time to practice ahead of the trip, my pictures turned out
We also appreciate the battery life, as well as the ease of charging with the provided cable.	Very happy w this very Portable rechargeable BOSE Speaker,,,, get this one !	Great speaker, excellent, have 2 and linked them, great sound.	Surprised this passed Bose QA testing, considering the price point.	We travel for a living Using our tablet to watch movies, the sound, battery life, sturdiness of the product completely satisfied us	As an audiophile,
music / podcast / relaxing / enjoying life, BUY them!	Apart from these things, amazing product.	Compared to other brands, bass level might be a bit less punchy, probably because these headphones reproduce a more balanced sound and don't over process the bass level.	poor quality headphones, do not spend your money on them.	Your not gonna be spinning discs at a DJ with these but the provide clear, undistorted sound at all appropriate levels.
When I originally ordered this device, the unit I received would disconnected every couple of minutes and reset.	After 2 days of testing, I had to return the product.	I use several USB devices such as external drives, headphones and memory card readers.	While I have USB 2 devices, I knew I'd want to use more than one USB 3 device at a time.	But after I received it, it did not fit in my
It had about 1.8 TB for use after installation and the updates.	It stop working after 2 years of having it.	Never had a problem after a few months of ownership.	I will be purchasing another one of these hard drives to replace the one that stopped working.	It does not need to be purchased separately.	Failed after 2.5 years of use for an xbox.	Bought this for my husband since he has one of
Bought for my wife , simply to use, takes very good photos, great deal for under a hundred dollars.	i love these little cameras .. simple, easy and great pictures.	sony lost my business, last sony product I will ever buy.	I wanted to replace my Lumix, but the few I found new on E-Bay where over $200.	I don't see the point in exchanging the camera, since another one might have worse problems.	Bought
Great Camera, as the days goes by I learn something new about this product.	I've never had a DSLR camera, before.	Came with the two lenses, bag, all I had to get was a memory card.	Had I known, I'd have ordered one at the same time as the camera, saved a couple of weeks.	After months of comparing cameras, and looking at reviews, I decided on this one.	However, by the end of the
My son loves them, he's had them for such a long time and haven't needed to buy him new ones	Great place for my son to put his headphones, keeps them from being pushed around and scratched up on his desk.	You will need to pickup the stand each time to place, and remove your headset since there isn't a lot of weight to them at all... which isn't a problem for me.	Perfect, my
Called D-Link tech support and after being walked through all of things I had already tried, I was asked what level of firmware was in my router and instructed to download the latest firmware and told to call back if that didn't fix it.	Also, I have not had any dropped connections or had any need to reboot the router.	Hopefully, they will release a firmware fix or something soon, or I guess I've got
My 1700X was boosted to 3.8 GHz, but the RAM stayed at 2133 MHz.	So far, this board meets expectations.	Bought this during Black Friday / Cyber Monday week, I've been using it for a month with no problems.	Amazon came through, though, and had a new one to me within 24 hours of my RMA request.	i would like to give a 5 star, but tit just came broken so i have no experience
I have tried to find help online or tech support but have not had any luck, I tried a different cord.	My system could not find the drivers, so I had to visit the Epson website to find and download the drivers.	I had to use a manual method, finally, after about an hour of other attempts.	After only a day, I wish I would have bought it months ago.	In all my years of
I did like his product however, after just 6 months multiple keys stopped working.	I purchased with the separate number pad and accessory kit, which allows each half to be angled.	I have been suffering from elbow, wrist and thumb pain for about a year.	I love this thing, it has helped out my elbow issues immensely.	Sure, I've remapped the keys.	Before the Freestyle2, I would often end work days with arm or wrist
He absolutely loved it, everything fits perfectly and stays in place.	A lot of room to hold switch, dock, games, charger and more.	Not the official Nintendo Switch case by Nintendo, but for a little cheaper it works well.	Big for traveling in a tight car, but everything we have associated with the switch fit in the case.	Not a big deal, but worth noting.	Either use the handle, or the strap over the shoulder.
Aside from that, this processor does the job and then some!	Fantastic gaming CPU, Bought for a straight up gaming rig, Handles Vega 64 in its stride really all you need for a gaming rig!	Paired with 16gb of FlareX 3200 ddr4, and Msi B350 gaming pro carbon, this thing screams.	Better than compared overprice Intel processor, purchased to built a gaming computer for my son.	You'll noeed to buy a graphics card with this
She really likes them.	They come in a nice thick material case, with a lens cloth, and a tough string so you can wear them around your neck.	Use them at work in daylight and low light, and they really help.	Just needed to have a little clarity on some distant activity in my neighborhood, and these do the job just great without looking like a set of CIA or FBI Government issued Bionic Binocs
It just died while I was traveling.	I only had two occasions when the GPS could find the address, nor the point of interest.	A couple of months ago I had an issue with the traffic feature and I tried to contact Tomtom via their customer support number and they no longer offer telephone support I tried to go on website to chat to no avail I ordered a brand new device from Tomtom and
I was amazed, after receiving an email from Urceri asking about my order.	I tried many times in two days, still doesn’t work.	It works fine, I've used it about 2-3 weeks.	I've used much higher priced meters than this before, and this one has some very nice features the others did not.	I wound up creating my own therapy light by assembling products purchased from Amazon, and now have the best light imaginable, and
Excellent camera, the best compact one out there by a margin!	For the price of this camera, Sony should include one memory card to get started!	Having owned the earlier version of this camera, it continues to impress with its image quality and minimalist sizing.	The best compact camera i've ever had in my hands.	A really wonderful photo tool for folks who don't want to be bothered by bulk and weight but still seek
We, as a group of desert riders found this very useful to communicate between SXS cars.	Though, these do hit those frequencies which would be vital for a SHTF kit or bugout bag.	Finding the right device to communicate with them has been a struggle, with most having very limited range, particularly in areas that appear to block line-of-sight.	must be worth the money, i had one stolen from the job site the first day.
Until I asked, Seagate did not even mention honoring the product's warranty.	Of course, the warranty seems to be 90 days so I am out of refund or replacement.	I called Seagate, waited 20 minutes to get a customer service rep.	I have several Seagate external HDDs now, ranging from 1Tb to 2Tb.	I've tested it on multiple computers, none of which recognized it.	Used to backup files, and only accessed about once or twice
They had connection issues from time to time, but for the most part they worked how I wanted.	They work, exactly how I had hoped.	Apple-bots might love them for brand loyalty, but otherwise expensive junk.	If you like listening to music or watching videos on your phone, tablet, or computer... pick these up and give em a try.	In my opinion, these work better than Apple's own airpods.	I’ve had to speak with Amazon
Used Canon, Fujifilm and Panasonic high end for the past 8 years.	I have been taking pictures of family and outdoors for over 68 years and, I believe this will be the best camera i have ever used.	Have not been able to put this camera down, and have yet to find myself in a situation where I wish I had more.	If I had to choose one camera for travel photography, this camera with
almost nothing wor for this tv, if they can just send a little money to hire some software engineer will be great.	It doesn’t have the top of the line features or the fastest refresh rate, but it does everything good enough for most folks, including me.	almost nothing work, wifi doesn't connect airplay don't work, Chromecast cuts off every 10 seconds, interface super laggy, click on the remote wait 2 seconds for the tv
I had a k-1000 with old lenses, so kept on the pentax brand in order to use the old lenses.	Don't recommend anymore, after a little more than two years of low usage the camera stopped to work.	lot of good features, wish it had more mp maybe 20!	I purchased this for my husband, he had been wanting a digital camera to work with his pentax lens he has and this was great price
However I saw another reviewer mention installing the latest Merlin firmware for this router and having no issues for a week, so I went and did the same thing and have had no drops or problems since!	Unfortunately, after two months of use, I now hate this router.	I have had Linksys, Belkin and Netgear routers, and none have come close to the performance of this router.	Have needed to restart at least once very
Ordered this for my daughter, wish I found it earlier.	Got to admit, I was going to purchase another bag.	EDIT: Now that a few years have gone by, I can say that this product caused me enough headaches.	In the past I've had to use a bag for my camera and lenses and a different bag for my laptop and note pads, because I don't alway need to bring my camera.	With that said,
My wife has had to come out and turn them down due to the fact she hears them clear as a bell in her office!	very nice speakers for the price,.good sound for CD’s..,.matching them with their S35 center speaker for TV.	Vinyl sounding great thru them so far, would be solid for a main set of L/R speakers in a home theatre set up as well	Black color hides them in the dark.	When
Got to navigate around windows 10, had 7.	After a month of use, I have had nothing but problems.	I’ve been disappointed in the battery, with a couple hours of typical typing and email, by the end of the day the battery has to be charged.	Best laptop I have ever bought, lighting fast, outperforming in all areas.	I also liked that I did not have to disable Windows10 S Mode prior to installing 3rd
I could never connect the device to my WiFi; after trying countless times, I am attempting to return the product.	I bought mine 2 years ago, but 4 months ago the usb stop working, in fact im quite sure the usb charging ports burns a tablet.	I’ve switch my WiFi over to 2.4, tried different devices, even different apps...nothing.	**After some time and true attention I realized that I had to sync the Jinvoo Smart
Please, do not waste your money on this brand.	You want a good 4k monitor, order this one!	At 30Hz Vsync locked, the panel works really well for games like skyrim, where aiming isn't really a twitch requirement.	Buy this, enjoy having the equivalent of four 1080P screens on one screen.	With OSX 10.9.3, MBP Late 2013 can scale this 4K display as 39" Retina display.	There has to be some kind of update to
It maybe had 15hrs of run time max.	Once i had a clean copy of Windows 10 installed and proper drivers fro Wifii and GPU etc this computer runs great.	any chance of returning this.	I bought two of these.	Hooked this up to two monitors and my external hard drive.	It really can't run origin games.	had to return unit the box was damaged when i got unit and the case and computer were
I changed to an Asus router RT-N12B1, and haven't had trouble connecting the printer.	I maybe print twice a month, if that.	I replaced a Canon that had developed a streak on scan problem with this printer, and wow!	I purchased this printer for my home office to replace a HP OfficeJet 4620, primarily because the Epson WF-3540 had the capability for duplex printing, while the HP OfficeJet 4620 did not.	By far the worst,
If it did not have a year warranty, I would have sent it back right away.	However, based on the performance of the first two machines I purchased, I will try again.	Based on prior reviews, I purchased this to connect to my Surface Pro 3.	Figuring I just got a bad unit, I purchased a second one and got the same results.	I then installed some of the included software from their DVD, no
It’s been plugged in for 4 months and I will soon be going back to Comcast to rent their modem.	Have had for a couple months now and have not had any drop outs.	It has been 3 days and havent had a problem streaming yet.	It's not my cable had them out already	So I had Comcast come out twice to do checks.	It does not increase my signal strength over the 15 year
Overall, very happy with this purchase.	Great sound relative to the price and size, very happy with this speaker.	When these work, they're great.	So, if you don't need a really loud speaker i would recommend the flare mini over the flare2.	Decent sound quality for indoor use but definitely not great for outdoor use, the sound doesn’t carry very far.	One still sounds great and performs daily very well, but the other one has
Surprisingly this sub has delivered, havent been able to drive it with specific audio but overall during the HD shows this has been good.	We get a better overall sound at a lower volume, now.	In this setup, the PSW111 really adds a needed bass punch without being overbearing or muddy.	I've always loved Polk Audio, and this PSW111 powered subwoofer shows why.	I had originally purchased one PSW 111 subwoofer a few years ago
The entire pan is tri clad and using this set on the glass-top stove is easy.	Heat the pan first, no higher than medium, put in oil/butter and boom, all is good.	Being able to put the pan in the oven was very important to me and this set fits the bill.	LOVE LOVE LOVE easy to use and clean the perfect size set for my extra small kitchen	The finish is great and comes
Cement basement, linoleum in kitchen, low pile rug in living room, this has made life a little easier and even the kids like to use.	The battery life on this is short, so plan on buying a backup battery so add another 50.00 to your purchase for the extra battery!	Thus a person who leaves the battery in the charger until they are ready to use it again, starts with a partially discharged battery.	But
Easy to clean, heats up quick and fits in the pantry shelf just like the old one.	After a year of light use, without ever scratching the surface it is time to replace the plates... the cost AMAZING USD 59 !!!	Nice grill, love the reversable/removable plates, however the release button on the top plate was broken right out of the box!	This product was purchased because the plates are removable and multi-useable (flat or
Easy to clean since the mess stays within the grill areas with side curbs.	There is a ridge all around the bottom grill that makes it hard to clean an difficult to remove ones sandwich.	There is a hook on the side to keep it closed when not in use and is easy to clean.	There is no temperature control, if one is not paying attention to it, food will burn very easy especially the
Was as described, finally got excess items off the bathroom vanity.	Kids love this, it covers the tops of the toothbrushes As well which protects from particles being sprayed by toilet flushing.	Stopped sticking.It should come with an extra sticker , other than that its ok.	There are plenty of room for more toothbrushes and the kids love the colors	It Looks nice but within a week it came out from the wall.	It worked
Grill function isnt the best but it functions notably different (and better for some applications) than a conventional microwave.	Very noisy oven (because the metal is too thin and lacking noise insulation).	The clear plastic over the buttons, On the start button only the clear plastic has peeled away.	Cheap, in 3 legs, the box is bent from transportation, but works.	Did not like that it smells like burning plastic and the outside gets way
He told us that this set has all the conduction of good copper pans and the ease of cleaning that the stainless steel or aluminum (not sure which) provides on the cooking surface.	Had spotting on the bottom of some pans out of the box.	At first glance the esthetics of these pans are impressive.	Possible inferior metal or improper storage at the manufacturer and/or distributor???	Arrived in excellent condition , even more beautiful than
Still working on fridge temp setting but it keeps drinks cold and freezer items frozen - Again, a Nice outdoor Fridge/Freezer Highly recommend this fridge ALOHA!	There are 6 tenements and the 2 fridges the land lord provides fills fast.	It came with a dented freezer door, as well as clearly not being stainless steel like the pictures (it has an uglier stucco texture.)	Not crazy about the shelving configuration inside and in the door
The skirt on this is very slippery and the best way to install it is to put it on one corner, then do the corner diagonally across.	LOVE LOVE LOVE this matress protector- make the occasioanl accidents easy to clean while completely protecting out matress.	T the reviews were all so good that we are giving it a try.	The price was fair, (unlike the store where we purchased our new bed, where they offered
The fit of everything was better than expected, with excellent stability throughout, helped by the very solid weight of the assembled product.	Very nice quality (black posts), color of the wood (purchased brown color) and it has a wonderful industrial-style look.	It has the wrought iron pillars, with real solid wood shelving (they are heavy, thick wood).	The board labeled "d" is cracked and one of the boards labeled "c" is broken.	The top is
The foams used are not evenly distributed in the mattress resulting in uneven corners and significant tilting.	It is a lot more firm than any other memory foam mattress we tried in stores, but the top layer is very soft.	At that point, we purchased the Casper.	We made the mistake of buying the Casper mattress.	We are both side sleepers and some of the reviews say it is too hard for side sleepers, but
the oil storage reservoir is ingenious, and is a great way to refrigerate clean oil, while being able to put everything else in the dishwasher (except for the actual heating element which can be rinsed off quickly with hot water).	Easy to clean and a better unit than the T-fal Roto Fryer and much easier to operate.	The only thing that would make it better is that there is nowhere to put the top after
The reheated pizza is better than the pizza in the pizzeria: the bottom is crispy and the top is hot and melted.	Since there is no ON /OFF switch on this unit a switched outlet eliminated the "plug in and out" issue.	Breville replaced the product for me promptly.	Easy to use, compact size but big enough to make two paninis at the same time.	Well made, complete surface heat at the same degree.	Was
(also the fast shipping) Bottom Line: Sturdy, easy to assemble and put away, and best of all the price is amazing for the quality!	Easy assembly, however the bed frame is bigger than a queen and it doesnt fit my queen sized headboard.	So easy to put together took 45 mins with the help of an 18 month old.	This bed frame is reasonably priced, attractive, extra sturdy, easy to put together (All of the
Was expecting a lot out of this coffee maker given the rave reviews everywhere online.	There really is a difference in the brew temp or other magic with these.	He thinks this is the best out there.	Many a reviewer has called this the best, believe them.	The coffee is great but the manufacturer DOES NOT RECOMMEND R.O.	Turns out that their 10 cup is the same as my old 8 cup.	The carafe is
The power cord is heavier than the steamer and pulled it off the counter when it hung down.	Note that there are other ones on Amazon but they were a little pricey and this item was very reasonably priced as nearly half the cost of the other ones.	There is no warning about this in the booklet that comes with the iron.	There were no signs that anything was wrong with the iron nor was
The only thing we do not like is that the warm mode is extremely warm, hot actually.	Easy to take to a party and love the automatic timer turning to warm!	Unfortunately straight out of the box we noticed the enamel is already scratched.	The new one is easy to use, and the timer is a great feature.	Cooks great and love the timer feature and it has a stay warm function too.	The latch
Heats foods near the back faster than items in the front near the door.	The door is wobbly and it came right out of the box like this.	Love the fact that food is warmed or cooked evenly without a turntable.	It has the option to save settings for certain foods (for quick 1 button heating) heats up evenly.	That is one month past the manufacturers warrantee.	When it arrived,...I was disapointed to see only
Easy to do but taking off the foot, which is where our clogs happen, takes a lot of pushing/maneuvering (I hold the stick and the white tab, then push the foot of the vacuum with my feet).	The rubber edge that catches the dirt makes it a bit clumsy to move around but, all in all, this Bissell is helpful.	For a fraction of the cost, this does a better job and is easier to
Great Cherry Pitter - good quality, easy to use, easy to clean and the splash guard makes less of a mess than those without.	Easy to use but after 10 cherries not one pit came through and got stuck the hole is too small for the seed to pass through would not buy again poor decision for purchase	Easy to use pitter but one still needs to be cautious to make sure the pit was
When my teen sits down "not so gently," the couch stays put instead of flying off the risers.	The middle part of it broke and no one was on the bed.	Perfect addition to the 6" risers when more height is needed, or alone if just 3" height is sufficient.	One of the legs recently broke on our dresser.	. . only downside is they look a bit big and clumsy for the application (no
Sturdy machine with two mesh filter system Coffee tastes great and is served hot So Easy to clean Love the large to go cup feature 2 Brew options give better control of coffee Tip.	Easy to clean, uses grounds and not kcups (less impact on the environment).	Apparently a non replaceable part had cracked so when brewing a cup all the water leaked out onto the counter.	read the instructions... not everyone is that smart
The reason why this thing is crap is because the warmer turns off too fast.	Pretty easy to clean (except some of the crevices in the lid) and it holds tons of food.	Love the easy clean up and cooks perfect rice or quinoa every time!	The cooking is precise and the buttons are easier to use than it looks... To keep it short, follow the instructions, baby the Teflon liner in the pot and
Easy to assemble and the dustpan can be fold to save space (which is so nice for me because my kitchen is always full of things)!	It has a "comb" (the red part on the pan) to remove hair from the brush, which is a very good idea, but it doesnt work very well and is awkward to use.	The bristles could be better quality but the design is really nice and easy to use.
Fits as discribed, the top is padded, the sides or skirt is very thin (see thru) elastic that snugs around the sides of the mattress.	Obviously the one fits tighter than the other, but the material along the sides is substantial, and the elastic hugs the bottom nicely.	This is a well made product that is manufactured in the USA.	It fit (stays in place); my mattress that is not one of the very thick,
Easy dispensing, steady temperature, easy to clean (important when the water is VERY hard).	Docking two stars because the nozzle drips and clogs from the grounds that spill over.	Pro: Water is hot Easy to dispense the water Con: The bottom is starting to corrode and particles come in to the water.	The concept is great (love the no-touch dispenser!0, but it is of no use to us if it is going to leak all
The wood top is about right but the paint color is way, way off.	The color (blue) is gorgeous and the look is stylish.	Plus the two holes for screws on the legs were not drilled on the cabinet piece.	The color is way darker than in the picture and one of the doors was cracked in half.	The top wood piece is damaged in several places and the side piece looks damaged as well.
Fairly easy to assemble with an exception of the face of the fan due to a cheaper plastic.	Pros: Lightweight, powerful, easy to assemble (other than the one con below).	The base is wide and stable, and the fan can be easily detached to make it easy to move to another location.	Easy ro assemble and clean but one thing that is the problem for me is the locks on the face of thr fan,
The problem with these kind of humidifiers is the surface that comes in contact with the air flow.	Brand new unit, fresh out of the box.	Put this little baby in and the problem is gone!	Keeps the camper smelling like new.	It definitely works and pulls moisture out of the air, but it is best for small spaces (closet, maybe a small bathroom).	For its size it has a rather large water holding cup,
These are a lot easier to use than the old fashioned plastic ice trays, the silicone makes it very easy to get them out and the covers area nice touch.	It is very easy to pop out the ice cubes from these trays.	Just like the title , it is easy to release the ice cubes from the tray.	Once frozen, the ice cubes popped right out of this Adoric Life 3-Pack Easy Release Silicon
The title says it all - this pan is awesome and makes the best chewy edge pieces.	The first batch of brownies in this amazing pan was called Brookies - brownie mix with chocolate chip cookie dough in the center.	Getting the browines out of the pan was even easier than a regualr square pan.	Unlike the perfect brownie pan, which is just stamped sheet metal with a cheap nonstick coating, this pan is heavy
Thicker than the rest, cleaning is tough but this is a problem with all mesh trays is best cleaned in a dishwasher.	The recipe called for putting the chicken on baking racks so the chicken would crisp on all sides.	Other cooling racks were not "cross-hatched" like these and the meat fell through.	Just rinse the big chunks off and throw it in the dishwasher.	This rack arrived with one of the metal grid pieces
When this happens, the spout of the kettle shoots out water.	Fagrile but works well and love the fact there are no plastic or metal parts.	(the photo shown on the amazon page is a black and white photo).	Never even came with the lid which is shown in picture.	My kettle arrived but the lid is shattered!	Bonus that this is easy to clean and see though.	It`s a 2-cup teapot, seemed bigger somehow
Not the sturdiest and also it hurts badly to use the ladder!	It did take us the better part of an afternoon to assemble, but really that is not too bad in my opinion.	The assembly instructions were easy to follow (just make sure the cross members are facing the right way).	Yes, there are a lot of pieces, but the instructions are solid and it took a little more than an hour to fully
The fact that this coffee maker does not keep the coffee hot is a huge deal.	As many of the previous reviews stated, this coffee machine leaked water all over the counter.	Love this maker except that the K-cup part leaks all over the counter from the back.	Support sent a new part, but not the part that was broken.	Love the carafe that keeps the pot of coffee warm without burning it.	The only
The best one out there and love the timer.	No problems with it at all.I would recommend it highly.	Love all of the features and how it evenly dries all of the goodies!	The only negative is that when we opened the box it was missing a liner.	Love the jerky and dried fruit.	The raisins had the same consistency and level of dehydration on each shelf.	Will wash all the trays again & give
Very good product, easy to set up and use, my only slight issue is that it is very heavy and was an issue to get it up the stairs	The machine is quiet and powerful and very impressed with it, has handles on the sides for easy moving.	The address label was stuck to the bottom of the box so the product was delivered upside down.	The product is compact and easy to use it
Easy to clean and the best feature is the material.	having control of the speed makes it easy to Just make great sausage.	It is easy to clean and the only meat left is a little bit in the tube, which is be expected.	The footpedal is a dream, the capacity is enormous, and the stainless steel so easy to clean.	The meat squishes out around the piston, still way better than trying to stuff
It makes the wood floor shines and looks new if the wood floor are not scratched, it does not really feels into the scratch.	Started leaking from the seam at the bottom, but they had double bagged it, so none of the the liquid was lost.	Then just dump this on the hardwoods and smooth it all out.	Bottle was cracked and all the liquid had spilled out.	Followed the directions and love the finish
The salt and pepper come out of the "top" of these grinders so that when they are sitting - nothing leaks.	They arrived looking significantly less glamorous than in the product photos (the black rubber knob is by far the dominant feature), and in damaged packaging (product undamaged, but the box was bent and torn, which was too bad, as these were a given as a gift).	The OXO emblem on the top of the
It was really easy to assemble, and is much more sturdy than expected - and it fit perfectly behind the door.	It was very easy to put together, and even though the materials are cheap (pvc pipe and particle board) it looks decent and seems sturdy.	While this item is great for a kids bedroom and is very easy to assemble, the VALUE is worth LESS than the $29 price.	It was easy to build,
Picture Falsely shows the Item with an Airator (SC) It is nothing bit a glass container.	and it seems like one tiny little tap chips the glass on the pouring edge.	This only includes the decanter base (ONLY 1 THING INCLUDED).	Has a more grande look in person than the picture lets off.	One problem though is the design of the decanter.	No where in the product details does it indicate that it is not
The mattress arrived and we quickly realized that it is not firm and the quality is no longer the same.	The only problem we are having is the odor.	:-)) Came with two free pillows, they were under the mattress when we rolled it out.	Mattress had no odor but the pillows had a strong chemical smell.	Upon opening it had the anticipated odor from the materials.	Our preference is the 15.5inch premier cool breeze,
If left plugged in makes an irritating random clicking noise nothing i saw in the instructions that say this is some type of alarm or anything.	To repair this requires taking the iron apart and replacing most of the upper body.	Rowenta provided another brand new iron and it leaked water as well, from the exact same spot (not the soleplate).	i called the manufacturer, and was advised that this is the way it is.
The force needed to insert the pegs is greater than the pressure required to break the brackets.	The instructions need to specify as to pushing the dowels in until they click, other than that is was OK.	Only problem is it was a bit of a pain to put together, just with all the pegs, and the plastic does have quite a bit of flex to it, so be careful when trying to move it
Love everything about this, soft handles, cooks well and evenly, believe the reviews, its a lot of good cookware for the money.	very nice quality cookware and come at a great price i love the non stick surface only bad thing is that 3 of my pans are dented so my lids are useless but i think it was the shipping company that did this i recommend that you put fragile on your boxes not
Easy to assemble, sturdy, actually spiralized better than the electric Aicok model with less effort and clean-up was good.	It was easy to use and worked well other than the spikes that hold the food in place started breaking off with first use.	It stays sturdily suctioned to the countertop, the blades are easy to change, and it cleans well.	Very nice, not afraid of cutting myself on the blades and easy for a Senior
The way these are made they have a hole in the bottom that is plugged.	Love that these glasses keep the coffee from getting cold.	The smooth edge on the top of the glass is much more pleasant on your lips than a traditional wine glass.	Loved these glasses, however, one glass broke on the top rack of the dishwasher when it says dishwasher safe.	Just had one have the inner bottom crack and drop
Suggest following the oiling instructions as it does look and feel better as it ages.	Either they sent a product with a poor surface, or maybe the manufacturer should provide an front-facing photo.	The boards do not lie flat on the counter top - it rocks back and forth a bit (e.g., top corner of one end and the bottom corner on the opposite end).	This cutting board is BIG and HEAVY duty however there
This pan is extremely well designed and very attractive pan that heats evenly and works quite well on our new induction range.	The most expensive, too, but this pan cooks well, looks and feel great.	All-Clad SS Copper Core box contained a Cuisinart sauce pan with All-Clad paperwork Previous order for same item came in an All-Clad box with a Chinese saucepan.	Simply the very best for sauces, simmers, and even quick boils for vegs.
I have pretty normal/narrow feet but I had to exchange for a 9.5 because I knew my toes would be cramped.	I debated about ordering a size down or staying to my true size so I stayed with my true size.	After months of trying to decide what size I should buy, I finally purchased my regular size which is 8.5.	They seem like great sturdy boots but even with my wide feet, I felt
I saw some reports that this brand used to be good but now made by another company in China.	Red & Blue is my favorite color.	Gotten compliments on their looks.	I couldn’t be happier.😎👍	I get lots of compliments on this pair.	They are what I was loooking for.	Fits well, there were a lot of loose strings that needed clipping, but no big deal.	The fit was right on, overall happy with this
For once I don't look like I have giant duck feet with this sleek style.	I’m sure my new black ones will be in heavy rotation as well.	I find this to be very uncomfortable.	I’m diabetic with sensitive feet.	I liked it so much that I ordered a second pair.	They are find for everyday use but not for more than 3 hours.	I also have some neuropathy in my left foot.	I wear
After looking at the reviews again, I see that this is a common problem.	Shoe is a bit darker than color in picture but I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.	At first, it did feel like I was walking with a monorail underneath, but that quickly went away.	Shoes seemed great, but as an occasional wear shoe I don't expect the soles to be shredding off in less than a year.	I must admit I
UGG website said every pair of genuine UGGS has a QR code that can be scanned to determine legitimacy.	I have been very happy with this slipper.	I doubt this would be a problem for those who have a wider foot.	Ordered size 4 was a little tight No problem with returned re order size 5 fits perfectly.	They just recently gave up on me so I have moved on to another style but these
I can go from work to dinner in this style.	I hoped to switch to Clark but there was just no comparison as far as support was concerned.	But I do wish I would have ordered my exact size.	I can even fit my half shoe orthodics.	Haven't worn it all day yet but I'm sure ti will come through well.	I’ve started ordering up a half size in Clark’s to give my toes more
Size on Stinger ran true, so I had to exchange my size 7 for what I normally wear.	I like to review products I have used for a while to ensure I give an accurate review.	It also makes a big difference when I don't wear any socks.	I started to get a tiny bit of dye transferring to my toes, not a lot.	I always thought Uggs were code for "ugly."	I only gave
Fit is larger/wider than other New Balance shoes I've bought.	Fits as I expected, but people new to New Balance should know that the trail shoes run a bit wider than the running shoes - so this pair is slightly large for me.	Feel like I have more energy to walk further.	Glad I can still find this shoe ~ works great with my orthotics.	The toe box is too small wife says after wearing
So decided to go with Reebok as I have seen a few of my co-workers wear this style of sneaker.	These are amazing shoes, great to wear when I'm on my feet standing for 8+hrs or going for daily exercise (I go on long fast paced walks, not jogging.	These shoes fits a little tighter compared to other brands but I'm been using Reebok forever so if you're new then buy half size larger.	But
Plus I’m over my return period by a few days.	if it fit would have been good.	I'm between sizes (6 to 6.5) but always order up with closed toe shoes especially pointy toes, which are gorgeous.	I want to return it but I have worn it once.	Unfortunately, I bought patent leather but this feels like rubber.	I am hoping with the real leather that this will soften over time but overall i am
I am just glad that ASICS had a non ugly florescence or neon colored shoe.	Side bits have a glossy sheen that I didn't expect, but I'm cool with it.	I love Asics shoes, this is the 3rd pair I have.	It is new so I have to wait for the shoe to stretch with regular use.	Like the shoe just about a half size smaller than I like.	Not sure what glue I can
As a 40+ year martial arts practitioner I am very picky about footwear.	Length is normal, width is a bit thin like all puma I've owned.	Foolishly I thought it would get better with wear.	I forgot that PUMA is usually a narrower shoe.	beginning of toe box is very snug, if not too tight.	Hurt my feet when I’m reffing indoor soccer.	Nice coushiony feel inside.

Like others have said: sizing is way off.	We returned 11am with a very cold weather .	Great shoes will enjoy them when snow come.	They make my four year olds feet like unnaturally wide.	They look durable .gr8 buy	Great looking boot, love it.	Have held up very well so far on my little guy.	So definitely, order 1-2 sizes larger than normal for your child.	My advise would be to go up 2
really beat up my feet because I didn't go a bit larger than what fit.	I went up more than a full size so there was plenty of length.	As for the fit, I've always measured 11.5 E on a Brannick device.	Once I broke it in I didn't get any more blisters.	I think we pulled an eyelet out of one pair but that was after more than 4 years of very rough wear.
I'm sure my foot hadn't changed so either this pair was made wrong or new balance is changing its sizing.	But, this pair only lasted 2+ months, midNov2018 to late Jan2019.	NB no longer seems to make SL-2 last shoes but this is as close as I could find in a tennis shoe.	I went with a 10 on the premise that I would wear a heavier, more cushioned sock.	I have been a New
As I stated in a previous request, my wife is very happy with it.	Might be comfy of I had a size that fit.I even ordered a size bigger than normal size.	I haven’t seen this sliper so comfortable lately.	Pretty, but not comfy like the spa sandals I was given at a spa day.	Other than that I'm pleased with my purchase.	First of all, I love this lovely happy aqua color.	I love
I have to be careful with work boots.	Like others have said, I just use boot socks with them.	Athletic socks won’t do it.	I was kinda upset about that because i thought it was going to be a strong leather type.	I'm in my boots sometimes 12-16 hours a day so I will be looking for something different next time.	I've had my first pair of boots for two years now, walking 3-5 miles
Remedied this with a heavier sock/or 2 light layered socks.	Good tread so I don't slip on snow/ice.	Keens feel great in me, so I've been committed.	A little clunky, but if I had a smaller foot, it would probably not seem that way.	Now I'm in an 8 which is still a bit roomy, but I'm OK with it.	I need good walking shoes and my feet appreciate a wide toe box -- Keen
I have never tried on a pair of shoes in my regular size being that narrow.	I have wider feet so I has to loosen up the aces to fit.	I have a pair of Adidas I’ve been wearing for almost 15 years that are in great shape.	In order to let my feet feel more comfortable I order a half size up.	The toe box is really wide.... which makes wearing this while running
I am very picky about my shoes, workout shoes especially.	I have only used then for two WOD's so far but I can tell a difference in terms of keeping my bakance while lifting.	I purchased this color for my 14 year old daughter.	I also feel like this pair provides better support for running.	Comfortable, well,price but a little bigger than I would have liked.	They made a significant difference in my WODS compared
Needed a reasonable priced shoe as I'm sure he isn't done growing.	As far as price goes anything under 60 is a steal.	By the way, I have normal & thin feet, hopefully this helps.	I find this shoe a little tighter than I had expected.	Because it fit to my expectations, feels like I'm walking on air.	I usually wear size 10-11, my feet are almost exactly 10-inches long.	Good shoe with different style....Have
Nothing better than a good warm pair of boots.	Happy to received my sons snow winter boots n it fits perfectly as expected..	Kamiks are our go-to boot of choice.	As someone mentioned here, you can take it out, but with it would go all the insulation as well.	So far so good with this style now that he is 5 years old.	They're going to work perfectly for our son for those purposes.	Seem
I grew up wearing Stride Rite shoes so my expectations where high.	They are not even black anymore.	Stride rite never lets me down.	Very comfortable shoe for my 1st grader.	No time to reorder or shop.	But I was wrong.my Lil girl loves her shoe so do I.	It is a required shoe for her uniform in her choir.	As to wear, the soles are intact, no significant wear.	I'm glad to see that
Great product wider fit than normal converse ,good price fast delivery.these look like canvas but are nice white leather.can recomend.	Really classic Converse everyone should own once in their life.	No more barricades behind her cosy bed.	perfect.. cant beat a new pair of converse to mark the sign that summer is here	So it came a bit bigger, but still be fine to wear.	As well as being too large, seem to be very
I had to sew a piece of Velcro so I could make it tight enough to wear comfortably.	I have many Ryka shoes buy this pair seems to be narrow.	After hip replacement I need firm foot support.	Took a chance that it would fit me, right out of the box.	They are really too short.	I have a pink pair in size 7.5 that fit great.	I have this sneaker in every color now.
I wear a large size so this is important to me...hate sending things back.	for me personally, I needed a half size bigger than my normal size.	I normally wear a medium width - this is definitely less than that.	For a more masculine shoe, I have no desire to have my feet look larger.	breathable,flexible,durable.the suede is actually kind of scuff resistant.	I don't see who it could fit comfortably - i do not
Fits very well it does seem slightly loose but I believe without that it would be difficult to put on.	at first I thought it must be how Hunter boots run.	I read reviews by their customers recommending people with half sizes to go down in size, not so in my case.	I choose a Hunter Size 7 for my US size 8 feet, and they fit well with a medium weight sock.	I normally
We had never heard of the Danner brand before...we are both very pleased.	I am very happy with my order.	I haven't tested the water proofing on the boots yet but with a name like Danner, one can only expect high performance.	Nothing has worked, I was expecting more from Danner.	Boots fit very well & look nice too.	I've only had it on a few hikes, but the fit so far feels right.	I
These are an unusual fleshy/peach/nude color.	I am flat footed, so it didn't matter.	I have tried bandaids, socks, cushioning.	XOXO, Erica Marie	During my daily commute, I would just switch to sneakers.	I will enjoy this pair of boots for all seasons.	The Heel Height: 1 1⁄2 inches is right height for me.	It is too bad as I love them but am not able to wear them.	These boots are just as expected,
Something must have changed in manufacturing though cause it feel like Im walking without any support or cushion in the heels.	By far my longest longevity boot I have ever owned.	With light wear it barely lasted a year, I could only imagine how long it would last in a rough environment.	Leather is a little softer than I expect in a work boot, but I suppose it is a pretty reasonable trade-off for not
I suggest knowing your size in this brand as certain sneaker brands can run differently.	Can't quite place it but I can just feel it.	I will continue to buy as long as there available in my size.	I bought an elastic shoe string called Lock Laces to use with the shoes.	I ordered a size 9 which is my shoe size but after a while my toes started to ache.	good shoe doesn't look
I'm in love with anything FitFlop makes, but this is just a flop flop.	Im an average width, I have purchased 8 before so I knew it would fit.	Highly recommend if you have no arch under your feet.	They still fit but took a few days to break in .	I wear this pool color pair of FitFlops when I work clinical shifts.	I own 4 pairs of Fitflops now.	These fit like other
I recieved so many compliments on it The shoe is absolutely beautiful.	They are so beautiful, I can't wait for my wedding day to wear them.	It was getting really hard to find ivory shoes that are actually ivory instead of stark white.	I looked for blue shoes for my wedding for months.	I wear a 7.5 in heels, but ordered a 7.	The fit was perfect, UNTIL, you have to walk in them.	Glad
For about 7 years I struggled with a paid of Timberland Pro steel toe boots.	I wear my boots for 9 hours a day, 5 days week, so comfort is paramount.	I hope keen can fix this problem.	Waterproofing didn't last as long as I'd hoped, but I also work with chemicals so I'm assuming that had something to do with that.	I did add some insoles after about 8 months.	not my first pair
I am happy to have found a pair of boots that have adjustable width.	I could see this style being uncomfortable on a shorter person.	I never could fit in boots without some option to expand in that area.	I would reccommend getting thick socks because your feet can get cold.	Normally I go up but in this case I tried on in a store first.	I can not fit a regular boot past my
If it rains or I step in a deep puddle my socks get wet but can dry quickly as well if not soaked.	I ordered a half size larger to accommodate insoles.	I love Merrell shoes, so this is a nice one to add to my collection.	But last weekend I went on a hike with a stream.	I'm a minimalist kind of girl but everything out there that claimed to be minimalist so far,
Once I got my boots, it felt like I had been given a new lease on life.	I went from a stylish pair of footwear at my workplace on Fridays...we are permitted to wear sneakers, I went for rugged class.	I personally will not waste my money again haven't enen used more than 90 days.	also some dull spots,on left shoe,not buffef quite right,upon assembly	Zippers work fine, no issue so far, that is a
They are lined all through with cozy fake fur.	Great snow boots for my Grandson.	For my grandson who lives in a cold climate.	He says his feet are really warm in snow.	They are soft all the way down to the toes.	So hopefully this helps when buying your boots.	Light on the feet, warm,comfortable, easy for kids on the spectrum who prefer velcro.	Really cute, nice fit, but zero ability to feet from
However if you have more muscular or just bigger calves in general, i'd recommend a different pair of boots.	My toes touched the inside toe of the boot, so I returned it for a Size fits perfect.	I can also wear them with thick socks comfortably.	I got compliments all day, but my feet also felt suffocated.	I do not like the 'popping' of the calf portion against my leg when I walk.	After a
I was looking for a non-insulated hiker with good traction for off trail use.	Haven't tested waterproof-ness, but I'm not expecting any issues there.	Warmth was not a problem with regular compression socks but I had a pair of wool socks handy just in case.	Perhaps I will go with Gore Tex lining next time.	Other than that I am satisfied with my new boots.	I do this to all my shoes, so my fit
I have already recommended Skecher golf shoes to my golfing buddies.	I wear a 9 EEEE, basically duck feet.	If you golf in 90 plus degree weather you might think about a more breathable shoe.	Skechers Golf Shoes - very comfortable.	Better looking than my Ecco's.	Shoes were just fine, but id not fit me well.	Extremely comfortable..let see performance while on score...If good, surely buy one more with another color.	It also keeps my
With this boot I will have to use thick socks or two pairs-which isn't really bad if we get a very cold winter.	so far everything I have purchased from amazon has been perfect.	Excelent product.	I just can't seem to get my size correct.	Grandson was so excited that he tried them on immediately.Fit was perfect,sole will be stiff until broken in.	So size adjustment has been a challenge with sz.	thank you my
I haven't had any issues with fit doing it this way.	Always my favorite running shoe, but since this one also comes in black, I can wear it to work with my uniform as well.	I did skip the first lacing hole due to my wide bunion feet.	I am very sad that Mizuno has discontinued this version of their running shoe line.	I have supinated feet with extremely high arches.	I always order this
I was looking for a walking shoe that was more comfy than my chucks, these ain’t them.	With a regular sock I might not have this problem.	I tried using thick socks but it didn't help.	I felt the shoe may be a little wide at point of purchase.	- I love this sneaker, I re-order a new pair as my other white Supergas get dirty.	I needed this sneaker ASAP because I have an
I already have some thigh high boots but wanted a flat boot because I knew I’d want total comfort along with looking cute some days .	So glad I don’t have to pull my boots up all night.	They were slightly loose on me but I’m sure would fit fine on someone with normal legs.	It looked quite silly so I sent it back.	I think I'm going to return it.	Good for narrow feet
Very good brand of shoes.	Otherwise it will look really weird because I don't know how to wardrobe.	However for a cheap everyday shoe this is perfect.	I bought this because another reviewer who had wide feet stated it was a good fit.	They were delivered a day late though.	Under Armour sneakers run small, this is my third UA sneaker purchase.	They are tight due to running style shoe but the look is awesome
Fit as expected, but my toes was not warm enough , cold, weld made good Quality , I did return it .	Assumed that going up 1/2 a size would allow for a heavier sock.	Hiking in Yellowstone has been great.	Warm, I live close to copper harbor Michigan.	Very cold with large amounts of snow.	I have not tested in bad weather yet thougj.	What is nice about this Keen Boot is that it
I have narrow feet, always an 8 in Asics products.	I have very flat feet which was causing me knee pains when I lifted.	Wearing compression socks, I'm good.	we had to return, we thought we measured my husbands feet correctly, but it is true to size.	I've never needed a wide shoe before but I would prefer that in this shoe.	Seems to be I very well built shoe also a very narrow shoe
Always have a couple pairs on hand, very versatile boot wether it be casual, construction, law enforcement or even its intended purpose, hiking.	At that point, I would have rather just spent more on different boots that were made for a real human foot.	However, I found this was NOT true in my case.	Even so, many are too narrow.	I work in landscaping, so this is my opinion.	Need I say more.	I consistently
The Fitbit community, once you interact with real people, is really dope as well.	The sleep tracking kind of off but I like everything else about this watch.	The heart rate monitor is often wrong, along with a few other functions.	The new replacement is a little better, but still inaccurate.	The combo has been so helpful in keeping me motivated and aware of how much I'm actually moving and eating.	The Fitbit battery is
The Fitletic belt is water resistant, it stays in place even better, and is even more comfortable.	The other one I have it not nearly as comfortable as this one but it holds water.	The belt gets really soaked with sweat, though, and becomes heavy - maybe they could use a different, thinner material?	The first one I ordered was way too big, so I ordered another, two sizes smaller, and I'm happy with it.
The only thing I would want to add would be some pockets inside for smaller items.	The smell of these bags was really strong, but thankfully wore off after 5 days or so of airing out.	The 3 of us that used them thought they worked out really well.	The bags arrived on time, and I would definitely purchase this item again.	The bags are well constructed and zipper easily and hold lots of stuff.
The umbrella is pretty light which makes carrying it when not in use easy.	The double canopy in this umbrella just doesn’t really work that well.	The color is wonderful - everyone seems to have a black umbrella and no one will walk away with mine in this pretty burgundy color.	The handle is foam-like and comfortable enough, but I would have preferred a shaped handle with a higher-quality rubberized surface.	The handle is a
The setup felt like you're putting big lego blocks together, and I felt it could've been more sturdy.	The basketball had a hole in it and couldn't even be blown up with air.	My kids were disappointed that they couldn't play with this right away.	The build quality is alright, just your standard Step2 quality, if you own any of their products.	We have it set up in our living room, if you can believe
The second night, we were hit with a very severe thunderstorm, with heavy winds, that lasted about an hour.	The only way this would hold 8 people is if they were children.	The auto-roll screens and built in light are fun, though probably not truly necessary.	The item arrived very quickly, Haven't used it yet but it looks great.	The fly basically didn't do its job, and water dripped in from about 6 different places,
The poles are thick and sturdy, they withstood quite a bit a wind during a rain storm.	The rain shield attachment on top is much appreciated, keeps tent shadier as well.	The only bad thing is lack of ventilation with the rain fly on.	The disappointing part was that when the first good downpour hit, ALL the corners leaked at the seams and made puddles of water inside the tent.	We have used this tent
The grill looks like it made of aluminum or some kind of soft metal.	The few times that I have used it, were all favorable experiences.	The grill burner tray arrived with ding marks as seen in photos.	We used just over one can of fuel in 4 days.	The surface is not easy to wipe off, any food stain will stay put on the material.	The only thing, I had a little surprise when
The leg holder is included (though not pictured), and is not as uncomfortable as some reviews made me fear.	The only exercise i don't like doing on this is benching.	The “refurbished” bowflex bench turned out to be a generic model with far less weight capacity, heavy ware, incomplete, and without instructions.	The newer model just has more variations on angles, but they are not really needed.	The cushioning feels like quality and there is
The setup took me 2 hours, just as stated in prior reviews.	The only thing I am seeing with this one that I am not sure of is a knocking noise once in a while when in use.	The bike seems exactly as described however it came with a hard rubber seat not a padded seat.	The bike operates well with one exception, which I had seen in other reviews-one pedal loosens up with each
The triangular metal plates have two with a Cap logo and two without, so if you grab two with the logo first, don't think all four have the logo.	The time and cost to drill larger holes and get safety bars = get another rack if you have any desire to squat or bench with a safety pin.	The product comes with 4 triangle support plates that connect the bars together at the bottom.	The
These are high quality leather gloves with double durable stitching.	The easy of removing the gloves after a workout is even better.	The level of support is better than any other glove I have owned.	The padding is thick enough that I no longer have palm pain from heavy weight.	The gloves are still useable just can’t wrap as tight as before.	These gloves are very well made like all their other products and fits
The ball is not round as a regular ball.	The customer service was good though and they sent me a new one about a week after i complained.	The material is very bad quality, each ball only last about 4 hrs of use	The ball looks really nice, but needs to be pumped up with every use.	The ball lasted about two months of practice with my U16 team before one popped and another lopsided.
The Dye i4 is already a great mask and writing about a winning design over and over again is moot.	The only thing that i didn't like is that the shipping took about a week more than expected.	The difference between this mask and anything else is absurd.	The top of your head will be exposed, so I recomend buying a skull cap of some sorts, but this mask is the BEST.	The mask is
The only thing I don't like is that there is not an easy-to use stop watch function.	The heart rate monitor is surprisingly pretty accurate, which was a concern since I've had other brands that didn't work too well.	The reason I don't like this product its because it doesn't have a timer or a chronometer.	The only exception , is that it doesn't count gardening, which to me is very physical especially if you
The speed numbers on this Bushnell product are completely inaccurate, as confirmed by other "real" radar guns.	The unit works best when you have a clear view to a car approaching or going away such as down a long straight away.	The kids love using it at practice.	We are very disappointed in this product.	The unit can give erroneous readings when multiple cars are bunched together and moving at different speeds, however, this isn't
The display is not as fancy as some others, but we don't care about that.	The company was very good about sending out a repair man who found a part that had moved during shipment.	The lowest resistance level was higher than any resistance I have ever experienced on any other exercise cycle.	The cost thru Amazon was better than what we found locally, and we have a better product as well.	The only complaint
The Franklin decal came off on day 1, gloves are comfortable.	These have lasted longer than other "high quality" batting gloves I've purchased.	The Shok-Sorb pads on these are really good - nice gloves.	The material is great and will last at least a season, probably two.	The pads around the thumb and throughout the glove are the best that I have found on Amazon.	After about 10 hours worth of games, they're working out
My kids still have fun after several years of use.	The bottom-line is, this thing breaks down way too easily.	Our Gandson Loves it so much, it's hard to keep him off of it.	We purchased through Amaazon last December and it has been a great buy; no problems with charging, etc...as some have mentioned.	The only thing I'd have added was roll cage padding which i fixed with racing roll cage padding and zip
There is resistance, I just hope that continues.	The ring is lightweight yet it provides a good amount of resistance.	The guide on how to use the ring was not included.	There are so many things you can do with it.	It’s just very disappointing, and I don’t feel in good conscience that I could ever recommend this brand.	The exercises provided can be improved upon, but there are plenty of resources online and on
The biggest problem is that the holding mechanism that holds the chain as you move it up and down is too small, and doesn't allow you to move it very far.	The chain did not slide through the bracket without being manually fed through, and the hole on the metal chain attachment used to adjust the height wasn’t large enough.	Love this product, we take it camping and cook on this.	The rope inside of
The insides were already getting holes in them and now today, this happens.	We ended up getting a size 1 skate, which was a little big but very comfortable with thick socks.	The skates delivered were even smaller than advertised.	The fit could be slightly better though.	The shoe we asked for size 3, and it shows that way, but unfortunately it's for size 1 or 1,5.	Fleece would be a good aspect, however, skates
The first draw of breath thru this call and you know you have something special in your hands.	The Duck Commander guys are on top of their game.	The story about how this call came about is truly amazing.	The hubby is a big duck hunter...spends more time and money playing duck, duck, goose than I care to think about.	Love it Love it Love it love it good call sounds just like a duck
The price was perfect, so I would have no problem ordering this again.	The material is good, just a design flaw, id recommend going elsewhere from a more reputable company like Rogue or Fringe sports.	The best part of all is that you get additional set of rope with parts and storage bag.	The length is adjustable and easy, they give you two wires (ropes) and one set of handles.	The turn is absolutely fabulous,
The gauge on mine matches the pressure reading of another, much pricier, gauge.	The gauge is not super accurate, and if you need to add a lot of air you would be better served with a larger pump.	The pump looks nice but does not functionally work at all.	The pump works great, is compact and seems very well made.	The pressure gauge doesn't work - it never moves from zero.	The screws provided are
The cast is as nice as any spin caster I’ve used.	The only issue I had is that probably in the transportation the nob that covers the whole at one side of the reel got lost.	The reel is so tight, winds perfectly, and cast farther than any spinning reel I own.	The 3000 pairs nicely with a Battalion inshore with 15lb braid.	The bail return spring broke on the first day, then the spool
The sizes they come in are as follows; Small 12-1ABEC, Medium 2-5 ABEC 5, Large 6-9 ABEC 7.	These skates are ok, they cost less but I didn’t feel very stable in them.	The Rollerblade Adjustable Inline Skates by High Bounce are great for rollerblading.	The perfection solution for feet that grow fast.	These are great, I love these skates.	The left skate wheels seemed a little off, but other than that, I would recommend
The overall value of this kettlebell can't be overstated, as most 24kg bells are between 80-100 bucks without shipping, this is killer deal with a prime account.	The product arrived much more quickly than I thought it would, and it looks very nice.	The finish is nice and even, no painful parts when swinging this thing around.	The colors found on other products do not make them work better.	The kettlebell just plainly allows more
The gloves are super awesome, customer service was also amazing in helping when I had questions.	The only gripe I'd have with them is that as a medium, they are just slightly too tight.	The gloves are very easy to swim with, without the need to alter your stroke.	He was delighted with them, says they are very useful.	The photo shows a high gloss pair of gloves with the logo and Web address, the
The coffee pot was exactly as described and after using it, find it is good quality and just as we expected.	The ONLY reason I am keeping it is because I cannot find any other brand that makes a 14 cup percolator.	The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the stem is really flimsy aluminum.	The glass top, broke after only being used 5 times.	These people have not ever
The reticle is cockeyed about 2deg off center so the scope looks funny on the rifle with cockeyed tubes sticking up at odd degrees.	The scope rings will work with a regular style iron site allthough you will get glimpses of it.	These are very compact full of more feature then you can imagine.	The edges are a bit blurry at 7,8 & 9 power but that can be true of scopes costing much more.
The ball were as good as any I've used.	The package contained 2 packages with 6 balls in each.	These balls are solid, heavy and so far indestructible.	The lacrosse balls were just as advertised.	The balls start cracking after very little use ive had mine for about 3 practices and most of them have cracks in them and that should not happen.	He shredded these like styrofoam in 2.....other brands of lacrosse balls were
The most fast deliver, i have ever had, 2 days.	These gloves are gorgeous as far as gloves can be gorgeous.	These leather gloves are stitched with very high quality, cushion, and wrist protection.	The only thing is - I am not so sure if 12oz is right for me.	These are comfortable and able, worth every penny!	These gloves are extremely durable and will last many years with rugged use.	These gloves are well
The tools provided along with this is not enough to assemble...unless you have prior professional experience.	The bench might be great but after over an hour using these tools ive only gotten half way takes a good 10 minutes each bolt with these tools.	The preacher with bicep attachment really sets this apart from other benches on Amazon.	The tools they provide are pretty worthless; You'd be better off with your own wrench set.	The
The band is elastic, so it sits well and doesn't move around much.	The only drawback is that sometimes over stuff it and have had things fall out when pulling out other items.	The material stretches to fit any phone (I have a Nexus 5) and also holds keys and an ID with no issues.	The iPhone 6 Plus fits with no problem...plenty of room for it, keys, etc.	The SG3 is a fairly large
The color and pattern is exactly as described and just beautiful, I get many compliments on it.	The "C" handle is also very handy when fumbling around with a purse, bags or keys.	The day after I received it, it was raining pretty good.	The design I got was an added bonus.	The other reviews were very helpful.	Love the way it closes, really makes it better when you're getting in the car.	The original
The only doors I could conceive of this fitting are 32" wide doors with 3.25" trim or narrower, or steel-framed doors.. Will not fit any doorway narrower than 29".	The material looks sturdy, but it is useless if you cannot use it.	The handles are soft and comfortable and can be used in many positions that allow you to train different muscle groups.	The one thing to look out for is, as others have mentioned,
These balls seem good, although I don’t know how they will hold up long term.	The kids love them, plenty so no one is fighting for them.	These were terrible, they all went flat within 6 weeks of getting them!	These remind me of when I was a kid, bouncy, heavy-duty rubber balls perfect for a playground or backyard.	The balls come deflated so I did ended up spending part of Christmas day pumping up
The stock tires lasted about 300 miles before they were nearly bald, whereas these tires still have more than 50% tread after 600 miles.	The shop showed me tires with kevlar/aramid reinforcement, they were much more firm even stiff in comparison to these.	The other problem as other reviews have noted is that they are not made by Schwinn.	The original of road tires that came with my bike were horrible on the road.	The
The reviews that say its easy have to be out here by people with a vested interest in Fitbit.	The body fat sensor is also fairly inaccurate, weighing yourself multiple times in a row will yield different body fat % by as much as 6 points.	The software won't function as it goes into an endless loop of error messages.	The app is useless with setup and when using a PC, it was a little
The other teachers thought I had made them because they were such good quality.	The smell of these is awful like straight gasoline not sure why but all of them were like that.	The size is also pretty good - can be used by an average size adult.	The material they are made with helps with grip.	The bags reeked strongly of oil, or kerosene, or some kind of petroleum product.	These were just what
The top does not bind as some previous compression socks have done.	The only thing with these socks is that they’re not as tight as I thought they would be.	The design of these socks could have also considered ankle support and there isn’t any support there.	The material is not thin as some reviewers have posted.	The colors I requested, I received some of and some I didn’t.	The socks seem like great quality...the
The view is clear and so far it holds zero, but I would not put this on a 308, 30-30, 270, or 30-06. it will be kissing your eye...	Put this on top of my CZ 457 American .22 Mag rifle, and it's perfect!	Unless issues develop with it somehow, this was incredible bang for my buck for an old .22LR.	The dusk and dawn coating on this scope works very well.	Have always been
The quality is exactly what I would expect in a gym, not a consumer product.	The reviews made it sound like it's hard to air up, it took me 3 mins tops.	The DVD that comes with it looks like it was produced 10 years ago in SD and 4:3.	Just one warning, this equipment should not be used if you have impaired mobility or frequently trip or fall.	The hose is not long enough
Just a few other facts about them: -Although they are heavy, they feel ok when skating -Great skates for amateurs like me -The wheels are good for outdoors or indoors -I had to adjust the wheels a little bit, cause they were too loose for me.	These guys are a nice fit,but still a little quick for me, but, I am not giving up, I know I can do this.	The skates were a gift
The quality is spotless, I have never seen any other knee sleeves that are as good as these.	The support and comfort I get from a thicker, better quality sleeve like these is so much better than what you can find at your local big box store.	These have been great, was getting some knee pain during squats.	The fit is good, I went with a medium and they are not too tight.	These offer
The racket is too light for me, i think this racket fits better on a woman.	The grip is lasting well, I really have no complaints.	The racquet isn't too heavy and has held up for a year of light playing so far.	The only thing to be aware of is that this racket does not come with a bag/sleeve.	The racket have plenty of power, I have a Wilson profile si 2.7 newly strung
My daughter likes these, she swims 2-3 times per week, they fit good.	My son loved them... so did some other kid, cause they didn’t come home from camp.	These stayed on well, had great suction, no leakage, and are comfortable.	These fit her better and don't fall off when she dives in.	These goggles are great, however they are TYR kids size which fit 3-10 year olds, not youth, as advertised fitting 10+.	My
The shipping was pretty fast as well, arrived 5 days before it was expected.	The previous 2 hats had no problems like that.	The one with folding brim fit a little tighter, and therefore better.	Best pair of wireless headphones I've ever had, I was surprised with how good they sound.	The volume and track control is not perfect; I kind of wish they were separate buttons, just cause less confusion.	The original one was
The foam grips are terrible, I will cut them off and replace them with something else.	The pull up bar is well built, very sturdy, and has 4 positions that give you numerous exercise options.	The only thing I have an issue with I suggest getting stronger lag bolts.	The variety of positions that you can do pull ups make this bar a must have in a home gym and the grips are very nice.
